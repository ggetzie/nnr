3 tablespoons mayonnaise  
1-1/2 teaspoons cider vinegar (or vinegar of your choice)  
3/4 teaspoon whole grain mustard  
1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce  
Salt and pepper  
#instructions  
1. Place eggs in medium saucepan, cover with 1 inch of water, and bring to boil over high heat. Remove pan from heat, cover, and let stand 10 minutes. Meanwhile, fill medium bowl with 1 quart cold water and about 14 ice cubes (1 tray). Transfer eggs to ice water with slotted spoon; let sit 5 minutes.

SPANISH-STYLE GARLIC SHRIMP  
#quantity  
SERVES 6  
Serve shrimp with crusty bread for dipping in the richly flavored olive oil.  
#ingredients  
14 garlic cloves, peeled  
1 pound large shrimp (31 to 40 per pound), peeled, deveined, and tails removed  
1/2 cup olive oil  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
1 bay leaf  
1 (2-inch) piece mild dried chile, such as New Mexican, roughly broken, seeds included  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons sherry vinegar  
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley  
#instructions  
1. Mince 2 garlic cloves and toss with shrimp, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and salt in medium bowl. Let shrimp marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes.  
2. Meanwhile, using flat side of chef’s knife, smash 4 garlic cloves. Heat smashed garlic with remaining 6 tablespoons olive oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until garlic is light golden brown, 4 to 7 minutes. Remove pan from heat and allow oil to cool to room temperature. Using slotted spoon, remove smashed garlic from skillet and discard.  
3. Thinly slice remaining 8 garlic cloves. Return skillet to low heat and add sliced garlic, bay leaf, and chile. Cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic is tender but not browned, 4 to 7 minutes. (If garlic has not begun to sizzle after 3 minutes, increase heat to medium-low.) Increase heat to medium-low; add shrimp with marinade to pan in single layer. Cook shrimp, undisturbed, until oil starts to gently bubble, about 2 minutes. Using tongs, flip shrimp and continue to cook until almost cooked through, about 2 minutes longer. Increase heat to high and add sherry vinegar and parsley. Cook, stirring constantly, until shrimp are cooked through and oil is bubbling vigorously, 15 to 20 seconds. Serve immediately.

SHRIMP TEMPURA  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
Do not omit the vodka; it is critical for a crisp coating. You will need a Dutch oven with a capacity of at least 7 quarts. Be sure to begin mixing the batter when the oil reaches 385 degrees (the final temperature should be 400 degrees). It is important to maintain a high oil temperature throughout cooking. Jumbo (16 to 20) or extra-large (21 to 25) shrimp may be substituted. Fry smaller shrimp in three batches, reducing the cooking time to 1-1⁄2 to 2 minutes per batch. When cooking shrimp for tempura, the underside tends to shrink more than the top, causing the shrimp to curl tightly and the batter to clump.  
#ingredients  
12 cups vegetable oil  
1-1⁄2 pounds colossal shrimp (8 to 12 per pound), peeled and deveined, tails left on  
1-1⁄2 cups all-purpose flour  
1⁄2 cup cornstarch  
1 cup vodka  
1 large egg  
1 cup seltzer water  
Kosher salt  
1 recipe dipping sauce   
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. In Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-low to 385 degrees, 18 to 22 minutes.  
2. While oil heats, make 2 shallow cuts about 1⁄4 inch deep and 1 inch apart on underside of each shrimp, following illustration. Whisk flour and cornstarch together in large bowl. Whisk vodka and egg together in second large bowl. Whisk seltzer water into egg mixture.  
3. When oil reaches 385 degrees, pour liquid mixture into bowl with flour mixture and whisk gently until just combined (it is OK if small lumps remain). Submerge half of shrimp in batter. Using tongs, remove shrimp from batter 1 at a time, allowing excess batter to drip off, and carefully place in oil (temperature should now be at 400 degrees). Fry, stirring with chopstick or wooden skewer to prevent sticking, until light brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to paper towel–lined plate and sprinkle with salt. Once paper towels absorb excess oil, place shrimp on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and place in oven.  
4. Return oil to 400 degrees, about 4 minutes, and repeat with remaining shrimp. Serve immediately with dipping sauce.

TOMATO AND MOZZARELLA TART  
#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
1 box frozen puff pastry, thawed in box in refrigerator overnight  
1 large egg, beaten  
2 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated (1 cup)  
1 pound plum tomatoes, cored and cut crosswise into 1⁄4-inch-thick slices  
Salt and pepper  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  
8 ounces whole-milk mozzarella cheese, shredded (2 cups)  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Dust counter with flour and unfold both pieces puff pastry onto counter. Following illustrations, form 1 large sheet, then make border, using beaten egg as directed. Sprinkle Parmesan evenly over shell. Using fork, uniformly poke holes in shell all over. Bake 13 to 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees. Continue to bake until golden brown and crisp, 13 to 15 minutes longer. Transfer to wire rack; increase oven temperature to 425 degrees.  
2. While shell bakes, place tomato slices in single layer on double layer of paper towels and sprinkle evenly with 1⁄2 teaspoon salt; let stand 30 minutes. Place another double layer of paper towels on top of tomatoes and press firmly to dry tomatoes. Combine garlic, olive oil, and pinch each salt and pepper in small bowl; set aside.  
3. Sprinkle mozzarella evenly over baked shell. Shingle tomato slices widthwise on top of cheese (about 4 slices per row); brush tomatoes with garlic oil. Bake until shell is deep golden brown and cheese is melted, 15 to 17 minutes. Cool on wire rack 5 minutes. Sprinkle with basil, slide onto cutting board or serving platter, cut into pieces, and serve.  
  
TO MAKE AHEAD: Tart shell can be prebaked through step 1, cooled to room temperature, wrapped in plastic wrap, and kept at room temperature for up to 2 days before being topped and baked with mozzarella and tomatoes.  
  
CHERRY TOMATO AND MOZZARELLA TART  
Omit salted and drained plum tomatoes and substitute the following mixture: In medium bowl, gently toss 1-1⁄2 pounds (2 pints) halved cherry tomatoes with 1⁄4 cup olive oil, 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, 3 thinly sliced large garlic cloves, 1-1⁄2 teaspoons sugar, 1⁄2 teaspoon salt, 1⁄4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, and 1⁄4 teaspoon pepper. Spread mixture in even layer on rimmed baking sheet and, after removing tart shell from oven, roast tomatoes until skins are slightly shriveled (tomatoes should retain their shape) about 30 minutes. (Do not stir tomatoes during roasting.) Prepare garlic oil and sprinkle mozzarella over baked shell as directed, then use slotted spoon to scatter roasted cherry tomato mixture on top of cheese. Brush with garlic oil and proceed as directed.  
  
SUN-DRIED TOMATO AND MOZZARELLA TART  
Replacing the plum tomatoes with sun-dried tomatoes turns this into an appetizer you can make any time of year.  
Substitute 1⁄2 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained, rinsed, and chopped fine, for plum tomatoes.

GREEK CHERRY TOMATO SALAD  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
If in-season cherry tomatoes are unavailable, substitute vine-ripened cherry tomatoes or grape tomatoes. Cut grape tomatoes in half along the equator (rather than quartering them). If you don’t have a salad spinner, after the salted tomatoes have stood for 30 minutes, wrap the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and gently shake to remove seeds and excess liquid. Strain the liquid and proceed with the recipe as directed. The amount of liquid given off by the tomatoes will depend on their ripeness. If you have less than 1⁄2 cup of juice after spinning, proceed with the recipe using the entire amount of juice and reduce it to 3 tablespoons as directed (the cooking time will be shorter).  
1-1⁄2 pounds cherry tomatoes, quartered  
Salt and pepper  
1⁄2 teaspoon sugar  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
1⁄2 teaspoon dried oregano  
1 shallot, minced  
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar  
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  
1 small cucumber, peeled, halved lengthwise, seeded, and cut into 1⁄2-inch dice  
1⁄2 cup chopped pitted kalamata olives  
4 ounces feta cheese, crumbled (1 cup)  
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley  
#instructions  
1. Toss tomatoes, 1⁄4 teaspoon salt, and sugar in medium bowl; let stand for 30 minutes. Transfer tomatoes to salad spinner and spin until seeds and excess liquid have been removed, 45 to 60 seconds, stirring to redistribute tomatoes several times during spinning. Return tomatoes to bowl and set aside. Strain tomato liquid through fine-mesh strainer into liquid measuring cup, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible.  
2. Bring 1⁄2 cup tomato liquid (discard any extra), garlic, oregano, shallot, and vinegar to simmer in small saucepan over medium heat. Simmer until reduced to 3 tablespoons, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer mixture to small bowl and let cool to room temperature, about 5 minutes. Whisk in oil and pepper to taste until combined. Taste and season with up to 1⁄8 teaspoon salt.  
3. Add cucumber, olives, feta, dressing, and parsley to bowl with tomatoes; toss gently and serve.

Continue to simmer potatoes, uncovered, until tender but still firm (thin-bladed paring knife can be slipped into and out of center of potato slice with no resistance), about 5 minutes. Drain potatoes, reserving 1⁄4 cup cooking water. Arrange hot potatoes close together in single layer on rimmed baking sheet.

Remove cover, increase heat to high (so cooking liquid will reduce), and cook 2 minutes.  
2. Drain potatoes in colander set over large bowl, reserving cooking liquid. Set drained potatoes aside. Pour off and discard all but 1⁄2 cup cooking liquid (if 1⁄2 cup liquid does not remain, add water to make 1⁄2 cup). Whisk remaining tablespoon vinegar, mustard, and oil into cooking liquid.

Continue to simmer until pork is no longer pink, about 2 minutes.  
5. Stir cornstarch mixture to recombine, then add to soup and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until soup thickens and turns translucent, about 1 minute. Stir in vinegar, chili oil, pepper, and remaining 3 tablespoons soy sauce and turn off heat.  
6. Without stirring soup, use soupspoon to slowly drizzle very thin streams of egg mixture into pot in circular motion. Let soup sit 1 minute, then return saucepan to medium-high heat. Bring soup to gentle boil, then immediately remove from heat. Gently stir soup once to evenly distribute egg. Ladle soup into bowls, top with scallions, and serve.

BEST FRENCH ONION SOUP  
#quantity  
SERVES 6  
#ingredients  
Use a Dutch oven with at least a 7-quart capacity for this recipe. Sweet onions, such as Vidalia or Walla Walla, will make this recipe overly sweet. Note that the entire process for caramelizing the onions takes 45 to 60 minutes. Use broiler-safe crocks and keep the rim of the bowls 4 to 5 inches from the heating element to obtain a proper gratinée of melted, bubbly cheese. If using ordinary soup bowls, sprinkle the toasted bread slices with Gruyère and return them to the broiler until the cheese melts, then float them on top of the soup.  
SOUP  
4 pounds onions, halved and sliced through the root end into 1⁄4-inch-thick pieces  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 3 pieces  
Salt and pepper  
2 cups water, plus extra for deglazing  
1⁄2 cup dry sherry  
4 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
2 cups beef broth  
6 sprigs fresh thyme, tied with kitchen twine  
1 bay leaf  
CHEESE CROUTONS  
1 small baguette, cut into 1⁄2-inch slices  
8 ounces shredded Gruyère cheese (2 cups)  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE SOUP: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Generously spray inside of Dutch oven with vegetable oil spray. Add onions, butter, and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, covered, for 1 hour (onions will be moist and slightly reduced in volume). Remove pot from oven and stir onions, scraping bottom and sides of pot. Return pot to oven with lid slightly ajar and continue to cook until onions are very soft and golden brown, 1-1⁄2 to 1-3⁄4 hours longer, stirring onions and scraping bottom and sides of pot after 1 hour.  
2. Carefully remove pot from oven (leave oven on) and place over medium-high heat. Cook onions, stirring frequently and scraping bottom and sides of pot, until liquid evaporates and onions brown, 15 to 20 minutes (reduce heat to medium if onions brown too quickly). Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until bottom of pot is coated with dark crust, 6 to 8 minutes, adjusting heat as necessary. (Scrape any browned bits that collect on spoon back into onions.) Stir in 1⁄4 cup water, scraping pot bottom to loosen crust, and cook until water evaporates and pot bottom has formed another dark crust, 6 to 8 minutes. Repeat process of deglazing 2 or 3 more times, until onions are very dark brown. Stir in sherry and cook, stirring frequently, until sherry evaporates, about 5 minutes.  
3. Stir in 2 cups water, chicken broth, beef broth, thyme, bay leaf, and 1⁄2 teaspoon salt, scraping up any final bits of browned crust on bottom and sides of pot. Increase heat to high and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 30 minutes. Remove and discard herbs and season with salt and pepper to taste.  
4. FOR THE CHEESE CROUTONS: While soup simmers, arrange baguette slices in single layer on rimmed baking sheet and bake until bread is dry, crisp, and golden at edges, about 10 minutes. Set aside.  
5. TO SERVE: Adjust oven rack 7 to 8 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Set 6 broiler-safe crocks on rimmed baking sheet and fill each with about 1-3⁄4 cups soup. Top each bowl with 1 or 2 baguette slices (do not overlap slices) and sprinkle evenly with Gruyère. Broil until cheese is melted and bubbly around edges, 3 to 5 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before serving.  
TO MAKE AHEAD: Onions can be prepared through step 1, cooled in pot, and refrigerated for up to 3 days before proceeding with recipe. Soup can be prepared through step 3 and refrigerated for up to 2 days.  
QUICKER FRENCH ONION SOUP  
This variation uses a microwave for the initial cooking of the onions, which dramatically reduces the cooking time. The soup’s flavor, however, will not be quite as deep as with the stovetop method. If you don’t have a microwave-safe bowl large enough to accommodate all of the onions, microwave in a smaller bowl in 2 batches.  
Combine onions and 1 teaspoon salt in large bowl and cover with large plate (plate should completely cover bowl and not rest on onions). Microwave for 20 to 25 minutes until onions are soft and wilted, stirring halfway through cooking. (Use oven mitts to remove bowl from microwave and remove plate away from you to avoid steam.) Drain onions (about 1⁄2 cup liquid should drain off) and proceed with step 2, melting butter in Dutch oven before adding wilted onions.

CLASSIC CREAM OF TOMATO SOUP  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
Make sure to use canned whole tomatoes that are not packed in puree; you will need some of the juice to make the soup.  
2 (28-ounce) cans whole tomatoes, drained, tomatoes seeded, and 3 cups juice reserved  
1-1⁄2 tablespoons dark brown sugar  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter  
4 large shallots, minced  
1 tablespoon tomato paste  
Pinch ground allspice  
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour  
1-3⁄4 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
1⁄2 cup heavy cream  
2 tablespoons brandy or dry sherry  
Salt  
Cayenne pepper  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Spread tomatoes in single layer over aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet and sprinkle evenly with brown sugar. Bake until all liquid has evaporated and tomatoes begin to color, about 30 minutes. Let tomatoes cool slightly, then peel them off foil and transfer to small bowl.  
2. Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add shallots, tomato paste, and allspice. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until shallots are softened, 7 to 10 minutes. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds. Whisking constantly, gradually add chicken broth. Stir in reserved tomato juice and roasted tomatoes. Cover, increase heat to medium, and bring to boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, to blend flavors, about 10 minutes.  
3. Strain mixture into medium bowl and rinse out saucepan. Transfer tomatoes and solids in strainer to blender. Add 1 cup strained liquid to blender and puree until smooth. Add remaining strained liquid.  
4. Return the pureed mixture to the saucepan, stir in cream, and heat over low heat until hot, about 3 minutes. Off heat, stir in brandy. Season with salt and cayenne to taste. Serve immediately.  
MAKE-AHEAD: Soup can be prepared through step 3 and refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 months. Reheat over low heat before proceeding with step 3.

CREAMLESS CREAMY TOMATO SOUP  
#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
Make sure to purchase canned whole tomatoes in juice, not puree. If half of the soup fills your blender by more than two-thirds, process the soup in three batches. You can also use an immersion blender to process the soup directly in the pot. For an even smoother soup, pass the pureed mixture through a fine-mesh strainer before stirring in the chicken broth in step 2.  
1⁄4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling  
1 onion, chopped  
3 garlic cloves, minced  
Pinch red pepper flakes (optional)  
1 bay leaf  
2 (28-ounce) cans whole tomatoes  
3 slices hearty white sandwich bread, crusts removed, torn into 1-inch pieces  
1 tablespoon brown sugar  
2 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
2 tablespoons brandy (optional)  
Salt and pepper  
1⁄4 cup chopped fresh chives  
1 recipe BUTTER CROUTONS  
#instructions  
1. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion, garlic, pepper flakes, if using, and bay leaf. Cook, stirring frequently, until onion is translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and their juice. Using potato masher, mash until no pieces bigger than 2 inches remain. Stir in bread and sugar. Bring soup to boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until bread is completely saturated and starts to break down, about 5 minutes. Remove and discard bay leaf.  
2. Transfer half of soup to blender. Add 1 tablespoon oil and process until soup is smooth and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to large bowl and repeat with remaining soup and oil. Rinse out Dutch oven and return soup to pot. Stir in chicken broth and brandy, if using. Return soup to boil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Ladle soup into bowls, sprinkle with chives, and drizzle with olive oil. Serve.

BUTTER CROUTONS  
#quantity  
MAKES ABOUT 3 CUPS  
#ingredients  
Either fresh or stale bread can be used in this recipe, although stale bread is easier to cut and crisps more quickly in the oven. If using stale bread, reduce the baking time by about 2 minutes. Croutons made from stale bread will be more crisp than those made from fresh. Be sure to use regular or thick-sliced bread (do not use thin-sliced bread).  
6 slices hearty white sandwich bread, crusts removed, cut into 1⁄2-inch cubes (about 3 cups)  
Salt and pepper  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Combine bread cubes and salt and pepper to taste in medium bowl. Drizzle with butter and toss well with rubber spatula to combine.  
2. Spread bread cubes in single layer on rimmed baking sheet or in shallow baking dish. Bake croutons until golden brown and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring halfway through baking time. Let cool on baking sheet to room temperature. (Croutons can be stored in airtight container for up to 3 days.)

CLASSIC GAZPACHO  
#quantity  
SERVES 8 TO 10  
#ingredients  
Use a Vidalia, Maui, or Walla Walla onion here. This recipe makes a large quantity because the leftovers are so good, but it can be halved if you prefer. Traditionally, diners garnish their gazpacho with more of the same diced vegetables that are in the soup, so cut some extra vegetables when you prepare those called for in the recipe. In addition to the GARLIC CROUTONS, chopped pitted black olives, chopped hard-cooked eggs, and finely diced avocados all make appealing garnishes. For a finishing touch, serve in chilled bowls.  
1-1⁄2 pounds tomatoes, cored and cut into 1⁄4-inch cubes  
2 red bell peppers, stemmed, seeded, and cut into 1⁄4-inch dice  
2 small cucumbers, one cucumber peeled, both sliced lengthwise, seeded, and cut into 1⁄4-inch dice  
1⁄2 small sweet onion or 2 large shallots, minced (about 1⁄2 cup)  
1⁄3 cup sherry vinegar  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
Salt and pepper  
5 cups tomato juice  
1 teaspoon hot sauce (optional)  
8 ice cubes  
8–10 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, for serving  
1 recipe GARLIC CROUTONS  
#instructions  
1. Combine tomatoes, bell peppers, cucumbers, onion, vinegar, garlic, and 2 teaspoons salt in large (at least 4-quart) bowl and season with pepper to taste.

Cover tightly and refrigerate to blend flavors, at least 4 hours or up to 2 days.  
2. Remove and discard unmelted ice cubes and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve cold, drizzling each portion with 1 teaspoon oil and topping with desired garnishes.  
QUICK FOOD PROCESSOR GAZPACHO

GARLIC-POTATO SOUP  
#quantity  
SERVES 6  
#ingredients  
A garnish is essential to add texture to this soup. We like Garlic Chips, but crisp bacon bits, FRIED LEEKS, or GARLIC CROUTONS are good options, too. A potato masher can be used instead of an immersion blender to mash some of the potatoes right in the pot, though the consistency will not be as creamy. If leeks are not available, substitute an equal amount of yellow onion. The test kitchen prefers the soup made with chicken broth, but vegetable broth can be substituted.  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1 leek, white and light green parts only, halved lengthwise, chopped small, and washed thoroughly  
3 garlic cloves, minced, plus 2 whole heads garlic, outer papery skins removed, and top third of heads cut off and discarded  
6–7 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
2 bay leaves  
Salt and pepper  
1-1⁄2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1⁄2-inch cubes  
1 pound red potatoes (unpeeled), cut into 1⁄2-inch cubes  
1⁄2 cup heavy cream  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme  
1⁄4 cup minced fresh chives  
1 recipe GARLIC CHIPS  
#instructions  
1. Melt butter in Dutch oven over medium heat. Add leeks and cook until soft (do not brown), 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add garlic heads, 6 cups broth, bay leaves, and 3⁄4 teaspoon salt. Partially cover pot and bring to simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer until garlic is very tender when pierced with tip of knife, 30 to 40 minutes. Add russet potatoes and red potatoes and continue to simmer, partially covered, until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.  
2. Discard bay leaves. Remove garlic heads from pot and, using tongs or paper towels, squeeze at root end until cloves slip out of their skins into bowl. Using fork, mash garlic to smooth paste.  
3. Stir cream, thyme, and half of mashed garlic into soup. Heat soup until hot, about 2 minutes. Taste soup and add remaining garlic paste if desired.  
4. Using immersion blender, process soup until creamy, with some potato chunks remaining. Alternatively, transfer 1-1⁄2 cups potatoes and 1 cup broth to blender or food processor and process until smooth. (Process more potatoes for thicker consistency.) Return puree to pot and stir to combine, adjusting consistency with up to 1 cup more broth if necessary. Season with salt and pepper to taste, sprinkle with chives and Garlic Chips, and serve.

2 medium leeks, halved lengthwise, green parts chopped and washed thoroughly, white parts sliced thin, washed thoroughly, and reserved for soup  
10 sprigs fresh parsley  
4 sprigs fresh thyme  
2 bay leaves  
1⁄2 ounce dried porcini mushrooms, rinsed  
SOUP  
1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained, tomato pieces chopped coarse  
12 ounces russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces  
2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces  
1⁄2 head celery root (14 ounces), peeled and cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces  
1 small head escarole (12 ounces), stemmed and leaves cut into 1-inch pieces (4 cups)  
1 cup frozen baby lima beans, thawed (optional)  
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley  
Salt and pepper  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE STOCK: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Place carrot, celery, onion, portobellos, and garlic head on rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with oil and toss to coat. Add tomato paste and toss again to coat. Spread vegetables in even layer, set garlic head cut side up, and roast until vegetables are well browned, 25 to 30 minutes.  
2. Combine roasted vegetables, broth, leek greens, parsley, thyme, bay leaves, and porcini in Dutch oven. Cover and bring to simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, 30 minutes.  
3. Remove garlic head from pot and, using tongs or paper towels, squeeze at root end until cloves slip out of their skins into small bowl. Using fork, mash garlic to smooth paste and set aside. Strain stock through large fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard solids in strainer.  
4. FOR THE SOUP: Rinse and wipe out Dutch oven. Add tomatoes, potatoes, carrots, celery root, reserved whites of leeks, strained broth, and garlic paste to pot and bring to simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, until vegetables are tender when poked with skewer or paring knife, about 25 minutes.

HEARTY MINESTRONE  
#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
If you are pressed for time you can “quick salt soak” your beans. In step 1, combine the salt, water, and beans in a Dutch oven and bring to a boil over high heat. Remove the pot from the heat, cover, and let stand 1 hour. Drain and rinse the beans and proceed with the recipe. We prefer cannellini beans, but navy or great Northern beans can be used. We prefer pancetta, but bacon can be used. To make this soup vegetarian, substitute vegetable broth for chicken broth and 2 teaspoons olive oil for the pancetta. Parmesan rind is added for flavor, but can be replaced with a 2-inch chunk of the cheese. In order for the starch from the beans to thicken the soup, it is important to maintain a vigorous simmer in step 3.  
Salt and pepper  
1⁄2 pound dried cannellini beans (1 cup), picked over and rinsed  
3 ounces pancetta, cut into 1⁄4-inch pieces  
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for serving  
2 celery ribs, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces  
1 carrot, peeled and cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces  
2 small onions, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces  
1 zucchini, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces (1 cup)  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
1⁄2 small head green cabbage, halved, cored, and cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces (2 cups)  
1⁄8–1⁄4 teaspoon red pepper flakes  
8 cups water  
2 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
1 Parmesan cheese rind  
1 bay leaf  
1-1⁄2 cups V8 juice  
1⁄2 cup chopped fresh basil  
Grated Parmesan cheese  
#instructions  
1. Dissolve 1-1⁄2 tablespoons salt in 2 quarts cold water in large bowl or container. Add beans and soak for at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours. Drain beans and rinse well.  
2. Heat pancetta and oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until pancetta is lightly browned and fat has rendered, 3 to 5 minutes. Add celery, carrot, onions, and zucchini and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened and lightly browned, 5 to 9 minutes. Stir in garlic, cabbage, 1⁄2 teaspoon salt, and pepper flakes and continue to cook until cabbage starts to wilt, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Transfer vegetables to rimmed baking sheet and set aside.  
3. Add soaked beans, water, broth, Parmesan rind, and bay leaf to Dutch oven and bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer vigorously, stirring occasionally, until beans are fully tender and liquid begins to thicken, 45 to 60 minutes.  
4. Add reserved vegetables and V8 juice to pot and cook until vegetables are soft, about 15 minutes. Discard bay leaf and Parmesan rind, stir in chopped basil, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with oil and grated Parmesan. (Soup can be refrigerated for up to 2 days. Reheat it gently and add basil just before serving.)

If soup is still thinner than desired once boiling, stir remaining cornstarch mixture to recombine and gradually stir mixture into soup; return to boil to fully thicken. Off heat, stir in lime juice and reserved ham; ladle soup into bowls and serve immediately, passing garnishes separately. (Soup can be refrigerated for up to 4 days. If necessary, thin it with additional chicken broth when reheating.)  
BLACK BEAN SOUP WITH CHIPOTLE CHILES

1 cup heavy cream  
1 tablespoon lemon juice  
1 sprig fresh tarragon  
Pinch cayenne pepper  
2 tablespoons dry sherry or Madeira  
Salt and pepper  
#instructions  
1. Peel 1⁄2 pound shrimp, reserving shells, and cut each peeled shrimp into thirds and set aside. Pat dry reserved shells and remaining unpeeled shrimp with paper towels.  
2. Heat 12-inch skillet over high heat until very hot, about 3 minutes. Add 1-1⁄2 tablespoons oil and swirl to coat bottom of pan. Add half of shell-on shrimp and half of reserved shells and cook until shrimp are deep pink and shells are lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Transfer shrimp to medium bowl and repeat with remaining 1-1⁄2 tablespoons oil, shell-on shrimp, and shells. Return first batch of shrimp to skillet. Off heat, pour brandy over shrimp and let warm through, about 5 seconds. Wave lit match over pan until brandy ignites, then shake pan to distribute flames. When flames subside, transfer shrimp and shells to food processor and process until mixture resembles fine meal, about 10 seconds.  
3. Heat butter in Dutch oven over medium heat. Add carrot, celery, onion, garlic, and ground shrimp and shells. Cover and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are slightly softened and mixture is fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute. Stir in clam juice, wine, and tomatoes, scraping pan bottom with wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits. Cover, increase heat to medium-high, and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring frequently, until soup is thickened and flavors meld, about 20 minutes.  
4. Strain bisque through fine-mesh strainer into medium bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Wash and dry Dutch oven, return strained bisque to pot, and stir in cream, lemon juice, tarragon, and cayenne. Bring to simmer over medium-high heat. Add reserved peeled and cut shrimp and simmer until shrimp are firm but tender, about 1-1⁄2 minutes. Discard tarragon, stir in sherry, season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve.

#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
1-1⁄2 pounds small shrimp (51 to 60 per pound), peeled and deveined; shells reserved  
3-1⁄2 cups ice water  
1 (8-ounce) bottle clam juice  
1⁄2 cup vegetable oil  
1⁄2 cup all-purpose flour  
2 onions, chopped fine  
1 red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and chopped fine  
1 celery rib, chopped fine  
6 garlic cloves, minced  
1 teaspoon dried thyme  
Salt and pepper  
Cayenne pepper  
2 bay leaves  
1 pound smoked sausage, such as andouille or kielbasa, sliced 1⁄4 inch thick  
1⁄2 cup minced fresh parsley leaves  
4 scallions, sliced thin  
#instructions  
1. Bring reserved shrimp shells and 4-1⁄2 cups water to boil in stockpot or large saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes. Strain stock and add ice water and clam juice (you should have about 8 cups of tepid stock, 100 to 110 degrees); discard shells. Set stock aside.  
2. Heat oil in Dutch oven or large saucepan over medium-high heat until it registers 200 degrees on instant-read thermometer, 1-1⁄2 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and gradually stir in flour with wooden spatula or spoon, making sure to work out any lumps that may form. Continue stirring constantly, reaching into corners of pan, until mixture has toasty aroma and is deep reddish brown, about 20 minutes. (Roux will thin as it cooks; if it begins to smoke, remove pan from heat and stir roux constantly to cool slightly.)  
3. Add onions, bell pepper, celery, garlic, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne to roux and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables soften, 8 to 10 minutes. Add 4 cups reserved stock in slow, steady stream while stirring vigorously. Stir in remaining 4 cups stock. Increase heat to high and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, skim foam from the surface with wide spoon, add bay leaves, and simmer, uncovered, about 30 minutes, skimming foam as it rises to surface. (Mixture can be covered and set aside for several hours or refrigerated up to 2 days. Reheat when ready to proceed.)  
4. Stir in sausage and continue simmering to blend flavors, about 30 minutes. Stir in shrimp and simmer until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Off heat, stir in parsley and scallions and season with salt, pepper, and cayenne to taste. Discard bay leaves and serve immediately.  
SHRIMP AND SAUSAGE GUMBO WITH OKRA  
Fresh okra may be used in place of frozen, though it tends to be more slippery, a quality that diminishes with increased cooking. Substitute an equal amount of fresh okra for frozen; trim the caps, slice the pods 1⁄4 inch thick, and increase the sautéing time with the onions, bell pepper, and celery to 10 to 15 minutes.  
Add 10 ounces thawed frozen cut okra to roux along with onions, bell pepper, and celery.  
SHRIMP AND SAUSAGE GUMBO WITH FILÉ  
Add 1-1⁄2 teaspoons filé powder along with parsley and scallions in step 4 after gumbo has been removed from heat. Let rest until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Adjust seasonings and serve.

3 tablespoons New Mexican chili powder or 3 medium chiles (about 3⁄4 ounce), toasted and ground  
2 tablespoons cumin seeds, toasted  
2 teaspoons dried oregano, preferably Mexican  
7-1⁄2 cups plus 2⁄3 cup water  
1 (4-pound) chuck-eye roast, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces

4–5 small jalapeño chiles, stemmed, seeded, and minced  
1 cup canned crushed tomatoes or plain tomato sauce  
2 tablespoons lime juice  
5 tablespoons masa harina or 3 tablespoons cornstarch  
#instructions  
1. Combine chili powders, cumin, and oregano in small bowl and stir in 1⁄2 cup water to form thick paste; set aside. Season beef with 2 teaspoons salt; set aside.  
2. Cook bacon in Dutch oven over medium-low heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towel–lined plate. Pour all but 2 teaspoons fat into small bowl; set aside. Increase heat to medium-high and sauté meat in 4 batches until well browned on all sides, about 5 minutes per batch, adding additional 2 teaspoons bacon fat to pot as necessary. Reduce heat to medium and add 3 tablespoons bacon fat to now-empty pan. Add onion and cook until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and jalapeños and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

SMOKY CHIPOTLE CHILI CON CARNE  
Make sure you start with a chuck-eye roast that is at least 3 inches thick. The grilling is meant to flavor the meat by searing the surface and smoking it lightly, not to cook it.  
1. Do not cut meat into 1-inch pieces. Puree 4 garlic cloves with 2 teaspoons salt. Rub intact chuck roast with puree and sprinkle evenly with 2 tablespoons New Mexican chili powder. Using large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, wrap 1 cup soaked mesquite or hickory wood chips in foil packet and cut several vent holes in top.  
2A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent halfway. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour in even layer over half of grill. Place wood chip packet on coals. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent halfway. Heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 5 minutes.  
2B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Place wood chip packet over primary burner. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 15 minutes. Leave all burners on high.  
3. Clean and oil cooking grate. Sear meat on all sides until well browned, about 12 minutes per side. Transfer roast to carving board, let cool, then cut into 1-inch cubes, discarding excess fat and reserving juices. Proceed with recipe from step 2 but do not brown beef. Substitute 2-1⁄2 tablespoons minced canned chipotle chile in adobo sauce for jalapeños, add browned beef with juices to pot with crisped bacon and proceed as directed.

ULTIMATE BEEF CHILI  
#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
A 4-pound chuck-eye roast, well trimmed of fat, can be substituted for the steak. Because much of the chili flavor is held in the fat of this dish, refrain from skimming fat from the surface. Dried New Mexican or guajillo chiles make a good substitute for the anchos; each dried de árbol may be replaced with 1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne. If you prefer not to work with any whole dried chiles, the anchos and de árbols can be replaced with 1⁄2 cup commercial chili powder and 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, though the texture of the chili will be slightly compromised. Good choices for condiments include diced avocado, finely chopped red onion, chopped cilantro, lime wedges, sour cream, and shredded Monterey Jack or cheddar cheese.  
Salt  
8 ounces (1-1⁄4 cups) dried pinto beans, picked over and rinsed  
6 dried ancho chiles, stemmed, seeded, and torn into 1-inch pieces  
2–4 dried de árbol chiles, stemmed, seeded, and split in 2 pieces  
3 tablespoons cornmeal  
2 teaspoons dried oregano  
2 teaspoons ground cumin  
2 teaspoons cocoa  
2-1⁄2 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
2 onions, cut into 3⁄4-inch pieces  
3 small jalapeño chiles, stemmed, seeded, and cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces  
3 tablespoons vegetable oil  
4 garlic cloves, minced  
1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes  
2 teaspoons molasses  
3-1⁄2 pounds blade steak, 3⁄4 inch thick, trimmed and cut into 3⁄4-inch pieces  
1 (12-ounce) bottle mild lager, such as Budweiser  
#instructions  
1. Combine 3 tablespoons salt, 4 quarts water, and beans in Dutch oven and bring to boil over high heat. Remove pot from heat, cover, and let stand 1 hour. Drain and rinse well.  
2. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Place ancho chiles in 12-inch skillet set over medium-high heat; toast, stirring frequently, until flesh is fragrant, 4 to 6 minutes, reducing heat if chiles begin to smoke. Transfer to food processor and cool. Do not wash out skillet.  
3. Add de árbol chiles, cornmeal, oregano, cumin, cocoa, and 1⁄2 teaspoon salt to food processor with toasted ancho chiles; process until finely ground, about 2 minutes. With processor running, slowly add 1⁄2 cup broth until smooth paste forms, about 45 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary. Transfer paste to small bowl. Place onions in now-empty processor and pulse until roughly chopped, about 4 pulses. Add jalapeños and pulse until consistency of chunky salsa, about 4 pulses, scraping down bowl as necessary.  
4. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until moisture has evaporated and vegetables are softened, 7 to 9 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chile paste, tomatoes, and molasses; stir until chile paste is thoroughly combined. Add remaining 2 cups broth and drained beans; bring to boil, then reduce heat to simmer.  
5. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Pat beef dry with paper towels and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt. Add half of beef and cook until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer meat to Dutch oven. Add half of beer to skillet, scraping up browned bits from bottom of pan, and bring to simmer. Transfer beer to Dutch oven. Repeat with remaining 1 tablespoon oil, remaining steak, and remaining beer. Stir to combine and return mixture to simmer.  
6. Cover pot and transfer to oven. Cook until meat and beans are fully tender, 1-1⁄2 to 2 hours. Let chili stand, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Stir well, season with salt to taste, and serve. (Chili can be refrigerated up to 3 days.)

4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and hot  
1 large egg white  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE STEW: Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels and season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1⁄4 teaspoon pepper. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chicken thighs, skin side down, and cook until skin is crisp and well browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Using tongs, flip chicken pieces and brown on second side, 5 to 7 minutes longer; transfer to large plate. Discard all but 1 teaspoon fat from pot.  
2. Add onions, carrots, and celery to now-empty pot; cook, stirring occasionally, until caramelized, 7 to 9 minutes. Stir in sherry, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pot. Stir in broth and thyme. Return chicken thighs, with any accumulated juices, to pot and add chicken wings. Bring to simmer, cover, and cook until thigh meat offers no resistance when poked with tip of paring knife but still clings to bones, 45 to 55 minutes.  
3. Remove pot from heat and transfer chicken to cutting board. Allow broth to settle 5 minutes, then skim fat from surface. When cool enough to handle, remove and discard skin from chicken. Using fingers or fork, pull meat from chicken thighs (and wings, if desired) and cut into 1-inch pieces. Return meat to pot. (At this point, stew can be cooled to room temperature, then refrigerated for up to 2 days. Bring to simmer over medium-low heat before proceeding.)  
4. FOR THE DUMPLINGS: Whisk flour, sugar, salt, and baking soda in large bowl. Combine buttermilk and melted butter in medium bowl, stirring until butter forms small clumps; whisk in egg white. Add buttermilk mixture to dry ingredients and stir with rubber spatula until just incorporated and batter pulls away from sides of bowl.  
5. Return stew to simmer, stir in parsley, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Using greased tablespoon measure (or #60 portion scoop), scoop level amount of batter and drop over top of stew, spacing about 1⁄4 inch apart (you should have about 24 dumplings). Wrap lid of Dutch oven with clean kitchen towel (keeping towel away from heat source) and cover pot. Simmer gently until dumplings have doubled in size and toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, 13 to 16 minutes. Serve immediately.

#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
4 chicken leg quarters (about 3 pounds), trimmed, thighs and drumsticks separated  
Salt and pepper  
1 (750-ml) bottle medium-bodied red wine  
2-1⁄2 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
1 teaspoon dried thyme  
10 parsley stems plus 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley  
1 bay leaf  
5 slices thick-cut bacon, cut into 1⁄4-inch pieces  
6–7 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature  
1 large carrot, chopped coarse  
1 large onion, chopped coarse  
2 shallots, peeled and quartered  
2 garlic cloves, skin on and smashed  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons tomato paste  
3⁄4 cup frozen pearl onions, thawed  
8 ounces white mushrooms, trimmed and halved if medium or quartered if large  
2–3 tablespoons all-purpose flour  
#instructions  
1. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper; set aside. Bring red wine and chicken broth to boil in large saucepan; reduce heat to medium-high and simmer until reduced to about 4 cups, about 20 minutes. Assemble thyme, parsley, and bay leaf together in double layer of cheesecloth and tie securely with kitchen twine to form bouquet garni.  
2. Meanwhile, cook bacon in Dutch oven over medium heat until fat has rendered and bacon is crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove bacon with slotted spoon to paper towel–lined plate; set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon butter with rendered bacon fat; add carrot, onion, shallots, and garlic and sauté until lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Press vegetables against side of pan with slotted spoon to squeeze out as much fat as possible; transfer vegetables to pan with reduced wine mixture (off heat) and discard all but 1 tablespoon fat from Dutch oven.  
3. Add 1 tablespoon butter to Dutch oven and heat over medium-high heat. Add chicken (in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding) and cook until well browned, 12 to 16 minutes. Transfer chicken to plate; set aside. Pour off fat from Dutch oven; return to heat and add wine-vegetable mixture. Bring to boil, scraping up browned bits from bottom of pan. Add browned chicken, bouquet garni, and tomato paste, bring to simmer, then reduce to low and simmer gently, partially covered, until chicken is tender, flipping once, 45 to 60 minutes.  
4. While chicken and sauce are cooking, heat 2 tablespoons butter in medium skillet over medium-low heat. Add pearl onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and almost cooked through, 5 to 8 minutes. Add mushrooms, season with salt, cover, increase heat to medium, and cook until mushrooms release their liquid, about 5 minutes. Uncover, increase heat to high, and boil until liquid evaporates and onions and mushrooms are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Transfer onions and mushrooms to plate with bacon; set aside.  
5. Transfer chicken to platter and tent loosely with aluminum foil. Strain sauce through fine-mesh strainer into large measuring cup, pressing on solids to release as much liquid as possible (you should have 2 to 3 cups liquid). Return sauce to pan and skim fat off surface. For each cup of sauce, mash 1 tablespoon each of butter and flour in small bowl or plate to make beurre manié (you should have 2 to 3 tablespoons each of butter and flour). Bring sauce to boil and whisk in beurre manié until smooth. Add reserved chicken, bacon, onions and mushrooms; season with salt and pepper to taste, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer gently to warm through and blend flavors, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste and stir in minced parsley. Transfer chicken to serving platter, pour sauce over chicken, and serve immediately.

1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
3 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained  
12 ounces Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into 3⁄4-inch pieces  
1⁄2 cup dry white wine  
1⁄4 cup pastis or Pernod  
1 (3-inch) strip orange zest  
1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon or parsley  
ROUILLE AND CROUTONS  
3 tablespoons water  
1⁄4 teaspoon saffron threads  
1 (12-inch) baguette  
4 teaspoons lemon juice  
1 large egg yolk  
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard  
2 small garlic cloves, minced  
1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
1⁄2 cup vegetable oil  
1⁄2 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  
Salt and pepper  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE BOUILLABAISSE: Adjust oven racks to middle and lower positions and heat oven to 375 degrees. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add chicken pieces, skin side down, and cook without moving until well browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Using tongs, flip chicken and brown other side, about 3 minutes. Transfer chicken to large plate.  
2. Add leek and fennel and cook, stirring often, until vegetables begin to soften and turn translucent, about 4 minutes. Add garlic, tomato paste, flour, saffron, and cayenne and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add broth, tomatoes, potatoes, wine, pastis, and orange zest; bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 10 minutes.  
3. Nestle chicken thighs and drumsticks into simmering liquid with skin above surface of liquid; cook, uncovered, 5 minutes. Nestle breast pieces into simmering liquid, adjusting pieces as necessary to ensure skin stays above surface of liquid. Bake on middle rack, uncovered, until breasts register 145 degrees and thighs/drumsticks register 160 degrees 10 to 20 minutes.  
4. FOR THE ROUILLE: While chicken cooks, microwave water and saffron in medium microwave-safe bowl until water is steaming, 10 to 20 seconds. Let sit for 5 minutes. Cut 3-inch piece off baguette; remove and discard crust. Tear crustless bread into 1-inch chunks (you should have about 1 cup). Stir bread pieces and lemon juice into saffron-infused water; soak 5 minutes. Using whisk, mash soaked bread mixture until uniform paste forms, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in egg yolk, mustard, garlic, and cayenne until smooth, about 15 seconds. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in vegetable oil in steady stream until smooth mayonnaise-like consistency is reached, scraping down bowl as necessary. Slowly whisk in 1⁄2 cup olive oil in steady stream until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  
5. FOR THE CROUTONS: Cut remaining baguette into 3⁄4-inch-thick slices. Arrange slices in single layer on rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Bake on lower rack until light golden brown (can be toasted while bouillabaisse is in oven), 10 to 15 minutes.  
6. Remove bouillabaisse and croutons from oven. Position oven rack 6 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Return bouillabaisse to oven and cook until chicken skin is crisp and breast registers 160 degrees and drumsticks/thighs register 175 degrees, 5 to 10 minutes (smaller pieces may cook faster than larger pieces; remove individual pieces as they reach correct temperature).  
7. Transfer chicken pieces to large plate. Skim excess fat from broth. Stir tarragon into broth and season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer broth and potatoes to large shallow serving bowls and top with chicken pieces. Drizzle 1 tablespoon rouille over each portion and spread 1 teaspoon rouille on each crouton. Serve, floating 2 croutons in each bowl and passing remaining croutons and rouille separately.

3 cups water  
2 bay leaves  
1 pound kale or collard greens, stemmed and leaves chopped into 1-inch pieces  
1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained  
1 sprig fresh rosemary  
8 slices country white bread, 1-1⁄4 inch thick, broiled until golden brown on both sides and rubbed with garlic clove (optional)  
#instructions  
1. Dissolve 3 tablespoons salt in 4 quarts cold water in large bowl or container. Add beans and soak at room temperature for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours. Drain and rinse well.  
2. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 250 degrees. Heat oil and pancetta in Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until pancetta is lightly browned and fat has rendered, 6 to 10 minutes. Add onion, carrots, and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened and lightly browned, 10 to 16 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in broth, water, bay leaves, and soaked beans. Increase heat to high and bring to simmer. Cover pot, transfer to oven, and cook until beans are almost tender (very center of beans will still be firm), 45 minutes to 1 hour.  
3. Remove pot from oven and stir in kale and tomatoes. Return pot to oven and continue to cook until beans and greens are fully tender, 30 to 40 minutes longer.  
4. Remove pot from oven and submerge rosemary in stew. Cover and let stand 15 minutes. Discard bay leaves and rosemary and season stew with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, use back of spoon to press some beans against side of pot to thicken stew. Serve over toasted bread, if desired, and drizzle with olive oil.  
HEARTY TUSCAN BEAN STEW WITH SAUSAGE AND CABBAGE  
This variation has much more meat and is made with crinkly savoy cabbage.  
Substitute 1-1⁄2 pounds sweet Italian sausage, casings removed, for pancetta; 1⁄2 head savoy cabbage, cut into 1-inch pieces, for kale; and 1 sprig fresh oregano for rosemary. Cook sausage in oil in step 2, breaking meat into small pieces with wooden spoon until it loses its raw color, about 8 minutes. Transfer sausage to paper towel–lined plate and place in refrigerator. Proceed with recipe as directed, stirring sausage and cabbage into stew along with tomatoes in step 3.  
VEGETARIAN HEARTY TUSCAN BEAN STEW  
Omit pancetta, substituting 3 cups vegetable broth for the chicken broth, and increase water to 4-1⁄2 cups. Microwave 1⁄2 ounce dried porcini mushrooms with 1⁄2 cup water in covered bowl until steaming, about 1 minute. Let stand until the mushrooms soften, about 5 minutes. Drain mushrooms through fine-mesh strainer lined with coffee filter, reserve liquid, and mince mushrooms. Stir mushrooms and reserved liquid into broth in step 2.  
QUICK HEARTY TUSCAN BEAN STEW  
To speed up this recipe, we used canned beans and cooked the stew completely on the stovetop.  
Replace dried cannellini beans with 4 (15-ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed well. Skip step 1 and omit oven instructions from the recipe. Reduce amount of chicken broth to 3 cups and water amount to 2 cups.

1 pound small red potatoes, peeled and halved  
4 large carrots, peeled and sliced 1⁄4 inch thick  
1 cup frozen peas, thawed  
1⁄4 cup minced fresh parsley  
#instructions  
1. Heat oven to 300 degrees. Season beef with 1-1⁄2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper; toss to coat. Heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat in Dutch oven. Brown meat on all sides in 2 batches, about 5 minutes per batch, adding remaining 1 tablespoon oil if necessary. Remove meat and set aside.

OLD-FASHIONED BEEF STEW WITH BACON, MUSHROOMS, AND PEARL ONIONS  
Instead of the frozen pearl onions, you can use an equal amount of fresh pearl onions that have been blanched, peeled, and steamed.  
Before preparing beef, cook 4 slices bacon, cut into small dice, in Dutch oven until browned and crisp. Transfer bacon to paper towel–lined plate, reserving fat. Substitute fat for oil when browning meat. Return bacon to Dutch oven with broth, bay leaves, and thyme. Omit potatoes, carrots, and peas. Heat 2 tablespoons of reserved fat in large skillet until hot and add 1 pound white mushrooms, quartered; cook over high heat until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add 1 cup frozen pearl onions, thawed, and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. When meat is almost tender, 2 to 2-1⁄2 hours, add mushrooms and pearl onions to stew. Cover and return to oven. Cook until meat and pearl onions are tender, 20 to 30 minutes longer. Stir in parsley, season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve.  
OLD-FASHIONED BEEF STEW WITH TOMATOES, ORANGE ZEST, AND OLIVES  
Substitute 1 cup canned diced tomatoes with their juice for 1 cup of broth. Add two 2-inch strips orange zest with broth. Substitute herbes de Provence for thyme. Omit potatoes, carrots, and peas. Stir in 1 cup pitted kalamata olives in step 3, cover stew, and let stand 5 minutes. Stir in parsley, season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve.  
OLD-FASHIONED BEEF STEW WITH TOMATOES, CINNAMON, AND CLOVES  
Add 1 tablespoon tomato paste after cooking flour. Substitute 1 cup canned diced tomatoes for 1 cup broth and add 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon and 1⁄8 teaspoon ground cloves with broth, bay leaves, and thyme. Omit potatoes, carrots, and peas. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in medium skillet; add 1 cup frozen pearl onions, thawed, and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. When meat is almost tender, 2 to 2-1⁄2 hours, add pearl onions and 1⁄3 cup currants to stew. Cover and return to oven. Cook until meat and pearl onions are tender, 20 to 30 minutes longer. Stir in parsley, season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve.

MODERN BEEF STEW  
#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
Use a good-quality, medium-bodied wine, such as a Côtes du Rhône or Pinot Noir, for this stew. Try to find beef that is well marbled with white veins of fat. Meat that is too lean will come out slightly dry. You can use 4 pounds of blade steaks, trimmed, instead of the chuck-eye roast. While the blade steak will yield slightly thinner pieces after trimming, it should still be cut into 1-1⁄2-inch pieces. Look for salt pork that is roughly 75 percent lean.  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
4 anchovy fillets, rinsed and minced  
1 tablespoon tomato paste  
1 (4-pound) boneless beef chuck-eye roast, pulled apart at seams, trimmed, and cut into 1-1⁄2-inch pieces  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
1 large onion, halved and sliced 1⁄8 inch thick  
4 carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces  
1⁄4 cup all-purpose flour  
2 cups red wine  
2 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
4 ounces salt pork, rinsed  
2 bay leaves  
4 sprigs fresh thyme  
1 pound Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces  
1-1⁄2 cups frozen pearl onions, thawed  
2 teaspoons unflavored gelatin  
1⁄2 cup water  
1 cup frozen peas, thawed  
Salt and pepper  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Combine garlic and anchovies in small bowl; press with back of fork to form paste. Stir in tomato paste and set aside.  
2. Pat meat dry with paper towels. Do not season. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in Dutch oven over high heat until just starting to smoke. Add half of beef and cook until well browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer beef to large plate. Repeat with remaining beef and remaining 1 tablespoon oil, leaving second batch of meat in pot after browning.  
3. Reduce heat to medium and return first batch of beef to pot. Stir in onion and carrots and cook, scraping bottom of pan to loosen browned bits, until onion is softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add garlic mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until no dry flour remains, about 30 seconds.  
4. Slowly add wine, scraping bottom of pan to loosen browned bits. Increase heat to high and simmer until wine is thickened and slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Stir in broth, pork, bay leaves, and thyme. Bring to simmer, cover, transfer to oven, and cook for 1-1⁄2 hours.  
5. Remove pot from oven; remove and discard bay leaves and salt pork. Stir in potatoes, cover, return to oven, and cook until potatoes are almost tender, about 45 minutes.  
6. Using large spoon, skim excess fat from surface of stew. Stir in pearl onions; cook over medium heat until potatoes and onions are cooked through and fork slips easily in and out of beef (meat should not be falling apart), about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, sprinkle gelatin over water in small bowl and allow to soften for 5 minutes.  
7. Increase heat to high, stir in softened gelatin mixture and peas; simmer until gelatin is fully dissolved and stew is thickened, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste; serve. (Stew can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.)  
TRIMMING A CHUCK-EYE ROAST  
To ensure consistent texture and flavor, avoid packaged stew meat (which can include odd-size pieces from all over the cow) and start with a chuck roast.  
1. Pull roast apart at its major seams (marked by lines of fat and silver skin). Use knife as necessary.  
2. With a sharp chef’s knife or boning knife, trim off the thick layers of fat and silver skin.

CARBONNADE À LA FLAMANDE (BELGIAN BEEF, BEER, AND ONION STEW)  
#quantity  
SERVES 6  
#ingredients  
Top blade steaks (also called blade or flatiron steaks) are our first choice, but any boneless roast from the chuck will work. If you end up using a chuck roast, look for the chuck-eye roast, an especially flavorful cut that can easily be trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces. Buttered egg noodles or mashed potatoes make excellent accompaniments to carbonnade. The traditional copper-colored Belgian ale works best in this stew. If you can’t find one, choose another dark or amber-colored ale of your liking.  
3-1⁄2 pounds blade steaks, 1 inch thick, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces  
Salt and pepper  
3 tablespoons vegetable oil  
2 pounds onions, halved and sliced 1⁄4 inch thick  
1 tablespoon tomato paste  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour  
3⁄4 cup low-sodium chicken broth  
3⁄4 cup beef broth  
1-1⁄2 cups beer  
4 sprigs fresh thyme, tied with kitchen twine  
2 bay leaves  
1 tablespoon cider vinegar  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position; heat oven to 300 degrees. Pat beef dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until beginning to smoke; add about one-third of beef to pot. Cook without moving until well browned, 2 to 3 minutes; using tongs, turn each piece and continue cooking until second side is well browned, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer browned beef to medium bowl. Repeat with 2 teaspoons oil and half of remaining beef. (If drippings in bottom of pot are very dark, add about 1⁄2 cup of chicken or beef broth and scrape pan bottom with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits; pour liquid into bowl with browned beef, then proceed.) Repeat once more with 2 teaspoons oil and remaining beef.  
2. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to now-empty Dutch oven; reduce heat to medium-low. Add onions, 1⁄2 teaspoon salt, and tomato paste; cook, scraping bottom of pot to loosen browned bits, until onions have released some moisture, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are lightly browned, 12 to 14 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add flour and stir until onions are evenly coated and flour is lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Stir in chicken and beef broths, scraping pan bottom to loosen browned bits; stir in beer, thyme, bay leaves, vinegar, browned beef with any accumulated juices, and salt and pepper to taste. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to simmer, stirring occasionally; cover partially, then place pot in oven. Cook until fork slips easily in and out of beef, about 2 hours.  
3. Discard thyme and bay leaves. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve. (Stew can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.)  

TRIMMING BLADE STEAKS  
1. Halve each steak lengthwise, leaving gristle on one half.  
2. Cut away gristle from half to which it is still attached, then cut trimmed meat into pieces.

Gradually whisk in chicken broth and remaining 1-1⁄2 cups water; increase heat to medium-high and bring to simmer, stirring frequently, until thickened. Pour mixture into pot. Add 3 cups wine, tomato paste, and salt and pepper to taste to pot and stir to combine. Set pot over high heat and bring to boil. Cover and transfer to oven; cook until meat is tender, 2-1⁄2 to 3 hours.  
6. Carefully remove pot from oven and, using tongs, transfer vegetable and herb bouquet to strainer set over pot. Press out liquid into pot and discard bouquet. With slotted spoon, remove beef to medium bowl; set aside. Allow braising liquid to settle for 15 minutes; with large spoon, skim fat from surface and discard.  
7. Bring liquid in pot to boil over medium-high heat. Simmer briskly, stirring occasionally to ensure that bottom is not burning, until sauce is reduced to about 3 cups and thickened to consistency of heavy cream, 15 to 25 minutes.  
8. FOR THE GARNISH: While sauce is reducing, bring pearl onions, butter, sugar, 1⁄4 teaspoon salt, and 1⁄2 cup water to boil in medium skillet over high heat; cover and reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, shaking pan occasionally, until onions are tender, about 5 minutes. Uncover, increase heat to high, and simmer until all liquid evaporates, about 3 minutes. Add mushrooms and 1⁄4 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid released by mushrooms evaporates and vegetables are browned and glazed, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables to large plate and set aside. Add remaining 1⁄4 cup water to skillet and stir to loosen browned bits. When pan bottom and sides are clean, add liquid to reducing sauce.  
9. When sauce has reduced to about 3 cups and thickened to the consistency of heavy cream, reduce heat to medium-low; stir in beef, mushrooms and onions (and any accumulated juices), remaining wine from bottle, and brandy into pot. Cover pot and cook until just heated through, 5 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve, sprinkling individual servings with minced parsley.  
TO MAKE AHEAD: In step 6, use tongs to transfer vegetable and herb bouquet to mesh strainer set over pot. Press out liquid into pot and discard bouquet. Let beef cool to room temperature in liquid in pot, then cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days. With slotted spoon, skim fat from surface and discard. Set pot over medium-high heat and bring to simmer; with slotted spoon remove beef to medium bowl and set aside. Simmer sauce briskly, stirring occasionally to ensure that bottom is not burning, until reduced to about 3 cups and thickened to consistency of heavy cream. Continue with recipe from step 8.

2 tablespoons unsalted butter  
2 onions, halved and sliced thin  
1 large carrot, peeled and chopped  
1 celery rib, chopped  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
2–3 cups beef broth  
3⁄4 cup dry red wine  
1 tablespoon tomato paste  
1 bay leaf  
1 sprig fresh thyme plus 1⁄4 teaspoon chopped  
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar  
#instructions  
1. Season pieces of meat with 1 tablespoon salt, place on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet, and let stand at room temperature for 1 hour.  
2. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Melt butter in Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and beginning to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add carrot and celery; continue to cook, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in 1 cup broth, 1⁄2 cup wine, tomato paste, bay leaf, and thyme sprig; bring to simmer.  
3. Pat beef dry with paper towels and season with pepper. Tie 3 pieces of kitchen twine around each piece of meat into even shape.  
4. Nestle meat on top of vegetables. Cover pot tightly with large piece of aluminum foil and cover with lid; transfer pot to oven. Cook beef until fully tender and fork slips easily in and out of meat, 3-1⁄2 to 4 hours, turning meat halfway through cooking.  
5. Transfer roasts to carving board and tent loosely with foil. Strain liquid through fine-mesh strainer into 4-cup liquid measuring cup. Discard bay leaf and thyme sprig. Transfer vegetables to blender. Let liquid settle for 5 minutes, then skim fat; add beef broth to bring liquid amount to 3 cups. Add liquid to blender and blend until smooth, about 2 minutes. Transfer sauce to medium saucepan and bring to simmer over medium heat.  
6. Meanwhile, remove twine from roasts and slice against grain into 1⁄2-inch-thick slices. Transfer meat to serving platter. Stir remaining 1⁄4 cup wine, chopped thyme, and vinegar into gravy and season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon half of gravy over meat; pass remaining gravy separately.  
TO MAKE AHEAD: Pot roast can be made up to 2 days ahead. Follow recipe through step 4, then transfer cooked roasts to large bowl. Strain and defat liquid and add beef broth to bring liquid amount to 3 cups; transfer liquid and vegetables to bowl with roasts, let cool for 1 hour, cover with plastic wrap, cut vents in plastic, and refrigerate overnight or up to 48 hours. One hour before serving, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Slice roasts as directed, place in 13 by 9-inch baking dish, cover tightly with foil, and bake until heated through, about 45 minutes.

Place remaining 1⁄4 cup cold water in small bowl and sprinkle gelatin on top.  
7. Transfer beef to carving board; tent with foil to keep warm. Let braising liquid settle, about 5 minutes; using large spoon, skim fat from surface. Remove herb bundle and stir in onion-mushroom mixture. Bring liquid to simmer over medium-high heat and cook until mixture is slightly thickened and reduced to 3-1⁄4 cups, 20 to 30 minutes. Season sauce with salt and pepper to taste. Add softened gelatin and stir until completely dissolved.  
8. Remove twine from roasts and discard. Slice meat against grain into 1⁄2-inch-thick slices. Divide meat among warmed bowls or transfer to platter; arrange vegetables around meat, pour sauce over top, and sprinkle with minced parsley. Serve immediately.  
TO MAKE AHEAD: Follow recipe through step 7, skipping step of softening and adding gelatin. Place meat back in pot, cool to room temperature, cover, and refrigerate for up to 2 days. To serve, slice beef and arrange in 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Bring sauce to simmer and stir in gelatin until completely dissolved. Pour warm sauce over meat, cover with foil, and bake in 350-degree oven until heated through, about 30 minutes.

1 (3-1⁄2-pound) boneless beef chuck-eye roast, pulled apart at seams and trimmed  
4 ounces pancetta, cut into 1⁄4-inch cubes  
2 onions, chopped  
2 carrots, chopped  
2 celery ribs, chopped  
1 tablespoon tomato paste  
3 garlic cloves, minced  
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour  
1⁄2 teaspoon sugar  
1 (750-ml) bottle Barolo wine  
1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained  
10 sprigs fresh parsley  
1 sprig fresh rosemary  
1 sprig fresh thyme, plus 1 teaspoon minced  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 300 degrees. Pat beef dry with paper towels, season with salt and pepper and tie both pieces together with kitchen twine. Place pancetta in 8-quart Dutch oven; cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and crisp, about 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer pancetta to paper towel–lined plate and set aside. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat; set Dutch oven over medium-high heat and heat until beginning to smoke. Add beef to pot and cook until well browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer beef to large plate and set aside.  
2. Reduce heat to medium, add onions, carrots, celery, and tomato paste to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables begin to soften and brown, about 6 minutes. Add garlic, flour, sugar, and reserved pancetta; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

BEEF STROGANOFF  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
Steak tips, also known as flap meat, are sold as whole steak, cubes, and strips. To ensure uniform pieces that cook evenly, we prefer to purchase whole steak tips and cut them ourselves. One and a half pounds of blade steak can be substituted for the steak tips; if using, cut each steak in half lengthwise and remove the gristle that runs down the center before cooking. Since blade steak yields smaller strips of meat, reduce the cooking time in step 3 by several minutes. If the mushrooms are larger than 1 inch, cut them into 6 even wedges. Serve the stroganoff over buttered egg noodles.  
1-1⁄4 pounds sirloin steak tips, trimmed and cut lengthwise with grain into 4 equal pieces  
2 teaspoons soy sauce  
1 pound white mushrooms, trimmed and quartered  
1 tablespoon dry mustard  
2 teaspoons hot water  
1 teaspoon sugar  
Salt and pepper  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
1 onion, chopped fine  
4 teaspoons all-purpose flour  
2 teaspoons tomato paste  
1-1⁄2 cups beef broth  
1⁄3 cup plus 1 tablespoon white wine or dry vermouth  
1⁄2 cup sour cream  
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley or dill  
#instructions  
1. Using fork, poke each piece of steak 10 to 12 times. Place in baking dish; rub both sides evenly with soy sauce. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 15 minutes or up to 1 hour.  
2. While meat marinates, place mushrooms in medium bowl, cover, and microwave until mushrooms have decreased in volume by half, 4 to 5 minutes (there should be as much as 1⁄4 cup liquid in bowl). Drain mushrooms and set aside; discard liquid. Combine mustard, water, sugar, and 1⁄2 teaspoon pepper in small bowl until smooth paste forms; set aside.  
3. Pat steak pieces dry with paper towels and season with pepper. Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place steak pieces in skillet and cook until browned on all sides and meat registers 125 to 130 degrees, 6 to 9 minutes. Transfer meat to large plate and set aside while cooking sauce.  
4. Add mushrooms, onion, and 1⁄2 teaspoon salt to skillet and cook until vegetables begin to brown and dark bits form on bottom of pan, 6 to 8 minutes. Add flour and tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until onions and mushrooms are coated, about 1 minute. Stir in beef broth, 1⁄3 cup wine, and mustard paste and bring to simmer, scraping bottom of pan to loosen browned bits. Reduce heat to medium and cook until sauce has reduced slightly and begun to thicken, 4 to 6 minutes.  
5. While sauce is reducing, cut steak pieces across grain into 1⁄4-inch-thick slices. Stir meat and any accumulated juices into thickened sauce and cook until beef has warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat and let any bubbles subside. Stir in sour cream and remaining tablespoon wine; season with salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

1 cup frozen pearl onions, thawed  
1⁄4 teaspoon granulated sugar  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
6 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE STEW: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Arrange short ribs bone side down in single layer in large roasting pan; season with salt and pepper. Roast until meat begins to brown, about 45 minutes; drain off all liquid. Return pan to oven and continue to cook until meat is well browned, 15 to 20 minutes longer. (For flanken-style short ribs, continue to cook until browned, about 8 minutes; using tongs, flip each piece and cook until second side is browned, about 8 minutes longer.) Transfer ribs to large plate; set aside. Drain off and reserve fat. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees. Heat roasting pan on 2 stovetop burners over medium heat; add wine and bring to simmer, scraping up browned bits. Set pan with wine aside.  
2. Heat 2 tablespoons reserved fat in Dutch oven over medium-high heat; add onions, carrots, and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables soften, about 12 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in flour until combined, about 45 seconds. Stir in wine from roasting pan, broth, tomatoes, rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, tomato paste, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to boil and add ribs, completely submerging meat in liquid; return to boil, cover, transfer to oven, and simmer until ribs are tender, 2 to 2-1⁄2 hours. Transfer pot to wire rack and cool, partially covered, until warm, about 2 hours.  
3. Transfer ribs to large plate and discard loose bones. Strain braising liquid into medium bowl, pressing out liquid from solids; discard solids. Cover ribs and liquid separately and refrigerate overnight. (Ribs and liquid can be refrigerated up to 3 days.)

Add defatted liquid and bring to simmer, stirring occasionally; season with salt and pepper to taste. Submerge ribs in liquid, return to simmer. Reduce heat to medium and cook, partially covered, until ribs are heated through and vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes longer; gently stir in bacon. Divide ribs and sauce among individual bowls, sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon parsley, and serve.  
PORTER-BRAISED SHORT RIBS WITH PRUNES, BRANDY, AND LEMON ESSENCE  
Brandy-soaked prunes take the place of vegetables here, so this version is particularly suited to a mashed root vegetable or potato accompaniment.  
Substitute 3 cups porter beer for red wine, omit rosemary, and substitute 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard and 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce for tomato paste. Continue with recipe through step 3. For garnish, bring 1⁄2 cup brandy to boil in small saucepan; off heat, add 8 ounces pitted prunes, halved, and let stand until plump and softened, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, spoon off and discard fat from braising liquid. Bring liquid to boil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Add prunes, brandy, and 2 teaspoons brown sugar; season with salt and pepper to taste. Submerge ribs in liquid and return to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until ribs are heated through, about 5 minutes longer; gently stir in 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest. Divide ribs and sauce among individual bowls, sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon parsley, and serve.

ONION-BRAISED BEEF BRISKET  
#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
1 (4- to 5- pound) beef brisket, flat cut preferred, trimmed  
Salt and pepper  
Vegetable oil  
2-1⁄2 pounds onions, halved and sliced 1⁄2 inch thick  
1 tablespoon brown sugar  
3 garlic cloves, minced  
1 tablespoon tomato paste  
1 tablespoon paprika  
1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour  
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth  
1 cup dry red wine  
3 bay leaves  
3 sprigs fresh thyme  
2 teaspoons cider vinegar  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Line 13 by 9-inch baking dish with two 24-inch-long sheets of 18-inch-wide heavy-duty foil, positioning sheets perpendicular to each other and allowing excess foil to extend beyond edges of pan. Pat brisket dry with paper towels. Place brisket fat side up on cutting board; using dinner fork, poke holes in meat through fat layer about 1 inch apart. Season both sides of brisket with salt and pepper.  
2. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until oil just begins to smoke. Place brisket, fat side up, in skillet (brisket may climb up sides of pan); weight brisket with heavy Dutch oven or cast-iron skillet and cook until well browned, about 7 minutes. Remove Dutch oven; using tongs, flip brisket and cook on second side without weight until well browned, about 7 minutes longer. Transfer brisket to platter.  
3. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from pan (or, if brisket was lean, add enough oil to fat in skillet to equal 1 tablespoon); stir in onions, sugar, and 1⁄4 teaspoon salt and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened, 10 to 12 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute; add tomato paste and cook, stirring to combine, until paste darkens, about 2 minutes. Add paprika and cayenne and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until well combined, about 2 minutes. Add broth, wine, bay leaves, and thyme, stirring to scrape up browned bits from pan; bring to simmer and simmer for 5 minutes to fully thicken.  
4. Pour sauce and onions into foil-lined baking dish. Nestle brisket, fat side up, in sauce and onions. Fold foil extensions over and seal (do not tightly crimp foil because foil must later be opened to test for doneness). Place in oven and cook until fork slips easily in and out of meat, 3-1⁄2 to 4 hours (when testing for doneness, open foil with caution as contents will be steaming). Carefully open foil and let brisket cool at room temperature, 20 to 30 minutes.  
5. Transfer brisket to large bowl; set fine-mesh strainer over bowl and strain sauce over brisket. Discard bay leaves and thyme from onions and transfer onions to small bowl. Cover both bowls with plastic wrap, cut vents in plastic, and refrigerate overnight.  
6. About 45 minutes before serving, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position; heat oven to 350 degrees. While oven heats, transfer cold brisket to carving board. Scrape off and discard any fat from surface of sauce, then heat sauce in medium saucepan over medium heat until warm, skimming any fat on surface with wide shallow spoon (you should have about 2 cups sauce without onions; if necessary, simmer sauce over medium-high heat until reduced to 2 cups). Slice brisket against grain into 1⁄4-inch-thick slices and place slices in 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Stir reserved onions and vinegar into warmed sauce and season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour sauce over brisket slices, cover baking dish with foil, and bake until heated through, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve immediately.  
SAME-DAY ONION-BRAISED BEEF BRISKET  
After removing brisket from oven in step 4, reseal foil and let brisket sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Transfer brisket to carving board and continue with straining, defatting, and reheating sauce and slicing meat; omit step of returning brisket to oven once reheated sauce is poured over it.

CHICKEN  
1 teaspoon salt  
1⁄2 teaspoon ground cumin  
1⁄2 teaspoon ground coriander  
1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed  
1 cup plain whole-milk yogurt  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
SAUCE  
3 tablespoons vegetable oil  
1 onion, chopped fine  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger  
1 fresh serrano chile, ribs and seeds removed, flesh minced  
1 tablespoon tomato paste

#instructions  
1. FOR THE CHICKEN: Combine salt, cumin, coriander, and cayenne in small bowl. Sprinkle both sides of chicken with spice mixture, pressing gently so mixture adheres. Place chicken on plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk yogurt, oil, ginger, and garlic together in large bowl and set aside.  
2. FOR THE SAUCE: Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until light golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, serrano, tomato paste, and garam masala and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes, sugar, and 1⁄2 teaspoon salt and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in cream and return to simmer. Remove pan from heat and cover to keep warm.  
3. TO COOK THE CHICKEN: While sauce simmers, position oven rack 6 inches from heating element and heat broiler. Using tongs, dip chicken into yogurt mixture (chicken should be coated with thick layer of yogurt) and arrange on wire rack set in aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet or broiler pan. Discard excess yogurt mixture. Broil chicken until thickest part registers 160 degrees and exterior is lightly charred in spots, 10 to 18 minutes, flipping chicken halfway through cooking.

INDONESIAN-STYLE FRIED RICE  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
If fresh Thai chiles are unavailable, substitute 2 serranos or 1 medium jalapeño. Adjust the spiciness of this dish by removing the ribs and seeds from the chiles. This dish progresses very quickly beginning with step 5; it’s imperative that your ingredients are in place and ready to go. This dish is traditionally served with sliced cucumbers and tomato wedges.  
2 tablespoons plus 1⁄2 cup vegetable oil  
2 cups jasmine or long-grain white rice, rinsed  
2-2⁄3 cups water  
5 green or red Thai chiles, stemmed  
7 large shallots, peeled  
4 large garlic cloves, peeled  
2 tablespoons dark brown sugar  
2 tablespoons light or mild molasses  
2 tablespoons soy sauce  
2 tablespoons fish sauce  
Salt  
4 large eggs  
12 ounces extra-large shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), peeled, deveined, tails removed, and cut crosswise into thirds  
4 large scallions, sliced thin  
Lime wedges  
#instructions  
1. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add rice and stir to coat grains with oil, about 30 seconds. Add water, increase heat to high, and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until all liquid is absorbed, about 18 minutes. Off heat, remove lid and place clean kitchen towel folded in half over saucepan; replace lid. Let stand until rice is just tender, about 8 minutes. Spread cooked rice onto rimmed baking sheet, set on wire rack, and cool for 10 minutes. Transfer to refrigerator and chill for 20 minutes.  
2. While rice is chilling, pulse chiles, 4 shallots, and garlic in food processor until coarse paste is formed, about 15 pulses, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary. Transfer mixture to small bowl and set aside. In second small bowl, stir together brown sugar, molasses, soy sauce, fish sauce, and 1-1⁄4 teaspoons salt. Whisk eggs and 1⁄4 teaspoon salt together in medium bowl.  
3. Thinly slice remaining 3 shallots (you should have about 1 cup sliced shallots) and place in 12-inch nonstick skillet with remaining 1⁄2 cup oil. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly, until shallots are golden and crisp, 6 to 10 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer shallots to paper towel–lined plate and season with salt to taste. Pour off oil and reserve. Wipe out skillet with paper towels  
4. Heat 1 teaspoon reserved oil in now-empty skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add half of eggs to skillet, gently tilting pan to evenly coat bottom. Cover and cook until bottom of omelet is spotty golden brown and top is just set, about 1-1⁄2 minutes. Slide omelet onto cutting board and gently roll up into tight log. Using sharp knife, cut log crosswise into 1-inch segments (leaving segments rolled). Repeat with 1 teaspoon reserved oil and remaining eggs.  
5. Remove rice from refrigerator and break up any large clumps with fingers. Heat 3 tablespoons reserved oil in now-empty skillet over medium heat until just shimmering. Add chile mixture and cook until mixture turns golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Add shrimp, increase heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring constantly, until exterior of shrimp is just opaque, about 2 minutes. Push shrimp to sides of skillet to clear center; stir molasses mixture to recombine and pour into center of skillet. When molasses mixture bubbles, add rice and cook, stirring and folding constantly, until shrimp is cooked, rice is heated through, and mixture is evenly coated, about 3 minutes. Stir in scallions, remove from heat, and transfer to serving platter. Garnish with egg segments, fried shallots, and lime wedges; serve immediately.

PAD THAI  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
Although pad thai cooks very quickly, the ingredient list is long, and everything must be prepared and within easy reach at the stovetop when you begin cooking. For maximum efficiency, use the time during which the tamarind and noodles soak to prepare the other ingredients. If tamarind paste is unavailable, substitute 1⁄3 cup lime juice and 1⁄3 cup water and use light brown sugar instead of granulated. To accurately measure boiling water, bring the water to a boil, then measure it. Look for rice stick noodles that are about the width of linguine. Tofu is a good and common addition to pad thai; if you like, add 4 ounces of extra-firm tofu or pressed tofu (available in Asian markets), cut into 1⁄2-inch cubes, to the noodles along with the bean sprouts.  
2 tablespoons tamarind paste  
3⁄4 cup boiling water  
3 tablespoons fish sauce  
3 tablespoons sugar  
1 tablespoon rice vinegar  
3⁄4 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
1⁄4 cup vegetable oil  
8 ounces dried rice stick noodles, about 1⁄8 inch wide  
2 large eggs  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
12 ounces medium shrimp (41 to 50 per pound), peeled and deveined  
3 garlic cloves, minced  
1 shallot, minced  
2 tablespoons dried shrimp, chopped fine (optional)  
2 tablespoons Thai salted preserved radish (optional)  
6 tablespoons dry-roasted peanuts, chopped  
6 ounces bean sprouts (3 cups)  
5 scallions, green parts only, sliced thin on bias  
1⁄4 cup fresh cilantro leaves (optional)  
Lime wedges  
#instructions  
1. Soak tamarind paste in boiling water for about 10 minutes, then push it through mesh strainer to remove seeds and fibers and extract as much pulp as possible. Stir fish sauce, sugar, rice vinegar, cayenne, and 2 tablespoons oil into tamarind liquid and set aside.  
2. Cover rice sticks with hot tap water in large bowl; soak until softened, pliable, and limp but not fully tender, about 10 minutes. Drain noodles and set aside. Beat eggs and 1⁄8 teaspoon salt in small bowl; set aside.  
3. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until just smoking. Add shrimp, sprinkle with remaining 1⁄8 teaspoon salt, and cook, tossing occasionally, until shrimp are opaque and browned around the edges, about 3 minutes. Transfer shrimp to plate and set aside.  
4. Off heat, add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and swirl to coat. Add garlic and shallot, return to medium heat, and cook, stirring constantly, until light golden brown, about 1-1⁄2 minutes. Add eggs and stir vigorously until scrambled and barely moist, about 20 seconds.  
5. Add noodles, along with dried shrimp and salted radish, if using, to skillet and toss to combine. Pour fish sauce mixture over noodles, increase heat to high, and cook, tossing constantly, until noodles are evenly coated.  
6. Scatter 1⁄4 cup peanuts, bean sprouts, all but 1⁄4 cup scallions, and cooked shrimp over noodles. Continue to cook, tossing constantly, until noodles are tender, about 2-1⁄2 minutes (if not yet tender, add 2 tablespoons water to skillet and continue to cook until tender). Transfer noodles to serving platter, sprinkle with remaining scallions, remaining 2 tablespoons peanuts, and cilantro. Serve immediately, passing lime wedges separately.

PORK LO MEIN  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
Use a cast-iron skillet for this recipe if you have one, as it will help create the best sear on the pork. Look for Chinese rice wine that is amber in color; if not available, sherry wine may be used as a substitute. If boneless pork ribs are unavailable, substitute 1-1⁄2 pounds of bone-in country-style ribs, followed by the next best option, pork tenderloin. It is important that the noodles are cooked at the last minute to avoid clumping.  
3 tablespoons soy sauce  
2 tablespoons oyster sauce  
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce  
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil  
1⁄4 teaspoon five-spice powder  
1⁄4 teaspoon liquid smoke (optional)  
1 pound boneless country-style pork ribs, trimmed and sliced crosswise into 1⁄8-inch pieces  
1⁄2 cup low-sodium chicken broth  
1 teaspoon cornstarch

12 ounces fresh Chinese egg noodles or 8 ounces dried linguine  
1 tablespoon Asian chili-garlic sauce  
#instructions  
1. Whisk soy sauce, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, sesame oil, and five-spice powder together in medium bowl. Place 3 tablespoons soy sauce mixture and liquid smoke, if using, in large zipper-lock bag. Add pork, press out as much air as possible, and seal bag, making sure that all pieces are coated with marinade. Refrigerate at least 15 minutes or up to 1 hour. Meanwhile, whisk broth and cornstarch into remaining soy sauce mixture in medium bowl and set aside. In small bowl, combine garlic, ginger, and 1⁄2 teaspoon vegetable oil and set aside.  
2. Bring 4 quarts water to boil in Dutch oven or large pot over high heat. Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in 12-inch cast-iron or nonstick skillet over high heat until just smoking.

Add 2 tablespoons wine to skillet and cook, stirring constantly, until liquid is reduced and pork is well coated, 30 to 60 seconds. Transfer pork to medium bowl and repeat with 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, remaining pork, and remaining 2 tablespoons wine. Wipe skillet clean with paper towels.  
3. Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil over high heat until just smoking. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until light golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Add scallions and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until scallions are wilted, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Transfer vegetables to bowl with pork.  
4. Add remaining 1 teaspoon vegetable oil and cabbage to skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until spotty brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Clear center of skillet, add garlic mixture, and cook, mashing mixture into pan, until fragrant, 15 to 20 seconds. Stir garlic mixture into cabbage.  
5. Return pork and vegetables to skillet. Add broth mixture and simmer until thickened and ingredients are well incorporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.  
6. Stir noodles into boiling water and cook, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender, 3 to 4 minutes for fresh Chinese noodles or 10 minutes for dried linguine. Drain noodles and return to Dutch oven. Add cooked stir-fry mixture and chili-garlic sauce to pot with noodles and toss until sauce coats noodles. Serve immediately.

PASTA CAPRESE  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
This dish will be very warm, not hot. The success of this recipe depends on high-quality ingredients, including ripe, in-season tomatoes and a fruity olive oil. Don’t skip the step of freezing the mozzarella, as freezing prevents it from turning chewy when it comes in contact with the hot pasta. If handmade buffalo- or cow’s-milk mozzarella is available (it’s commonly found in gourmet and cheese shops packed in water), we highly recommend using it, but do not freeze it.  
1⁄4 cup extra-virgin olive oil  
2 teaspoons lemon juice, plus extra as needed  
1 small shallot, minced  
1 small garlic clove, minced  
Salt and pepper  
1-1⁄2 pounds tomatoes, cored, seeded, and cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces  
12 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces and patted dry with paper towels  
1 pound penne, fusilli, or other short, tubular pasta  
1⁄4 cup chopped fresh basil  
Sugar  
#instructions  
1. Whisk oil, lemon juice, shallot, garlic, 1⁄2 teaspoon salt, and 1⁄4 teaspoon pepper together in large bowl. Add tomatoes and gently toss to combine; set aside. Do not marinate tomatoes for longer than 45 minutes.  
2. While tomatoes are marinating, place mozzarella on plate and freeze until slightly firm, about 10 minutes. Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot. Add pasta and 1 tablespoon salt and cook, stirring often, until al dente. Drain pasta well  
3. Add pasta and mozzarella to tomato mixture and gently toss to combine. Let sit for 5 minutes. Stir in basil, season with additional lemon juice, salt, pepper, and sugar to taste, and serve immediately.

DEBEARDING MUSSELS  
Mussels often contain a weedy beard protruding from the crack between the two shells. It’s fairly small and can be difficult to tug out of place. To remove it easily, trap the beard between the side of a small knife and your thumb and pull to remove it. The flat surface of a paring knife gives you some leverage to remove the beard.

12 garlic cloves, minced  
1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained  
1 cup dry white wine  
1⁄2 teaspoon sugar  
1⁄4 cup minced fresh parsley

2. Meanwhile, toss shrimp with 2 tablespoons oil, 1⁄2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, and 3⁄4 teaspoon salt. Heat 12-inch skillet over high heat. Add shrimp, spread into even layer, and cook, without stirring, until bottoms of shrimp turn spotty brown, about 30 seconds.

POTATO GNOCCHI WITH BROWNED BUTTER AND SAGE SAUCE  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
POTATO GNOCCHI  
2 pounds russet potatoes  
1 large egg, lightly beaten  
3⁄4 cup plus 1 tablespoon (4 ounces) all-purpose flour, plus extra for counter  
Salt  
BROWN BUTTER AND SAGE SAUCE  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces  
1 small shallot, minced  
1 teaspoon minced fresh sage  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons lemon juice  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE GNOCCHI: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Poke each potato 8 times with paring knife over entire surface. Place potatoes on plate and microwave until slightly softened at ends, about 10 minutes, flipping potatoes halfway through cooking. Transfer potatoes directly to oven rack and bake until skewer glides easily through flesh and potatoes yield to gentle pressure, 18 to 20 minutes.  
2. Hold potato with pot holder or kitchen towel and peel with paring knife. Process potato through ricer or food mill onto rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining potatoes. Gently spread potatoes into even layer and cool for 5 minutes.  
3. Transfer 3 cups (16 ounces) warm potatoes to large bowl. Using fork, gently stir in egg until just combined. Sprinkle flour and 1 teaspoon salt over potato mixture. Using fork, gently combine until no pockets of dry flour remain. Press mixture into rough dough, transfer to lightly floured counter, and gently knead until smooth but slightly sticky, about 1 minute, lightly dusting counter with flour as needed to prevent sticking.  
4. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and dust liberally with flour. Cut dough into 8 pieces. Lightly dust counter with flour. Gently roll piece of dough into 1⁄2-inch-thick rope, dusting with flour to prevent sticking. Cut rope into 3⁄4-inch lengths. Hold fork, with tines facing down, in 1 hand and press side of each piece of dough against ridged surface with thumb to make indentation in center; roll dough down and off tines to form ridges. Transfer formed gnocchi to prepared sheets and repeat with remaining dough.  
5. FOR THE SAUCE: Melt butter in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat, swirling occasionally, until butter is browned and releases nutty aroma, about 1-1⁄2 minutes. Off heat, add shallot and sage, stirring until shallot is fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in lemon juice and salt and cover to keep warm.  
6. Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot. Add 1 tablespoon salt. Using parchment paper as sling, add half of gnocchi and cook until firm and just cooked through, about 90 seconds (gnocchi should float to surface after about 1 minute). Remove gnocchi with slotted spoon, transfer to skillet with sauce, and cover to keep warm. Repeat with remaining gnocchi and transfer to skillet. Gently toss gnocchi with sauce to combine and serve.

RICOTTA GNOCCHI WITH BROWNED BUTTER AND SAGE SAUCE  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
When rolling the gnocchi, use just enough flour to keep the dough from sticking to your hands and work surface. If you prefer, replace the browned butter sauce with PORCINI MUSHROOM SAUCE WITH CREAM or CLASSIC BASIL PESTO.  
1 pound (2 cups) whole-milk ricotta cheese  
2 slices hearty white sandwich bread, crusts removed and bread torn into quarters  
1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated (1⁄2 cup)  
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus extra as needed  
1 large egg  
2 tablespoons minced fresh basil  
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley  
Salt  
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper  
1 recipe BROWN BUTTER AND SAGE SAUCE, warm  
#instructions  
1. Set fine-mesh strainer over bowl and line with 3 coffee filters. Place ricotta in prepared strainer, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees.  
2. Meanwhile, pulse bread in food processor to fine crumbs, about 15 pulses. Spread crumbs on rimmed baking sheet and bake, stirring occasionally, until dry and just beginning to turn golden brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer to bowl, cool to room temperature, then stir in Parmesan and flour.  
3. Transfer drained ricotta to now-empty food processor and pulse until curds break down into fine, grainy consistency, about 8 pulses. Transfer ricotta to large bowl and stir in egg, basil, parsley, 1⁄2 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Stir in bread-crumb mixture until well combined. Refrigerate dough until slightly tacky and few crumbs stick to fingers when touched, about 15 minutes. (If dough is too wet and several crumbs stick to fingers, stir in flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until dough is slightly tacky.)  
4. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and dust lightly with flour. Cut dough into 8 pieces. Lightly dust counter with flour. Gently roll piece of dough into 3⁄4-inch-thick rope, dusting with flour to prevent sticking. Cut rope into 3⁄4-inch lengths and transfer to prepared sheets. Repeat with remaining dough.  
5. Bring 4 quarts water to simmer in large pot. Add 1 tablespoon salt. Using parchment paper as sling, add half of gnocchi and cook until firm and just cooked through, about 3 minutes, adjusting heat as needed to maintain simmer (gnocchi should float to surface after about 1 minute). Remove gnocchi with slotted spoon, transfer to skillet with sauce, and cover to keep warm. Repeat with remaining gnocchi and transfer to skillet. Gently toss gnocchi with sauce to combine and serve.  
TO MAKE AHEAD: Sheets of gnocchi can be wrapped with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 24 hours or frozen; when completely frozen, gnocchi can be transferred to zipper-lock bag and stored in freezer for up to 1 month. Spread frozen gnocchi on baking sheet and thaw overnight in refrigerator or at room temperature for 1 hour before cooking.

2 large eggs  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper  
16 no-boil lasagna noodles  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE SAUCE: Pulse 1 can tomatoes with their juice in food processor until coarsely chopped, 3 or 4 pulses; transfer to bowl. Repeat with remaining can tomatoes; transfer to bowl.  
2. Heat oil, garlic, and pepper flakes, if using, in large saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until garlic turns golden but not brown, about 3 minutes.

3. FOR THE CHEESE FILLING: Combine ricotta, mozzarella, 1 cup Parmesan, eggs, parsley, basil, salt, and pepper in bowl.  
4. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Pour 2 inches boiling water into 13 by 9-inch broiler-safe baking dish. Slip noodles into water, 1 at a time, and soak until pliable, about 5 minutes, separating noodles with tip of sharp knife to prevent sticking. Remove noodles from water and place in single layer on clean kitchen towels; discard water and dry dish.  
5. Spread 1-1⁄2 cups sauce evenly over bottom of dish. Using spoon, spread 1⁄4 cup cheese mixture evenly onto bottom three-quarters of each noodle (with short side facing you), leaving top quarter of noodle exposed. Roll into tube shape and arrange in dish seam side down. Top evenly with remaining sauce, making certain that pasta is completely covered. (Assembled manicotti can be covered with sheet of parchment paper, wrapped in aluminum foil, and refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 1 month. If frozen, thaw manicotti in refrigerator for 1 to 2 days. To bake, remove parchment, replace foil, and increase baking time to 1 to 1-1⁄4 hours.)  
6. Cover dish tightly with foil and bake until bubbling, about 40 minutes, rotating dish halfway through baking. Remove dish from oven and remove foil. Adjust oven rack 6 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Sprinkle manicotti evenly with remaining 1 cup Parmesan. Broil until cheese is spotty brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Cool manicotti for 15 minutes before serving.

FOUR-CHEESE LASAGNA  
#quantity  
SERVES 10  
#ingredients  
Note that some pasta brands contain only 12 no-boil noodles per package; this recipe requires 15 noodles. Whole milk is best in the sauce, but skim and low-fat milk also work. Supermarket-brand cheeses work fine in this recipe. The Gorgonzola may be omitted, but the flavor of the lasagna won’t be as complex. It’s important to not overbake the lasagna. Once the sauce starts bubbling around the edges, uncover the lasagna and turn the oven to broil. If your lasagna dish is not broiler-safe, brown the lasagna at 500 degrees for about 10 minutes. This lasagna is very rich; serve small portions with a green salad.  
6 ounces Gruyère cheese, shredded (1-1⁄2 cups)  
2 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated fine (1 cup)  
12 ounces (1-1⁄2 cups) part-skim ricotta cheese  
1 large egg  
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper  
2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons minced fresh parsley  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1 shallot, minced  
1 garlic clove, minced  
1⁄3 cup all-purpose flour  
2-1⁄2 cups whole milk  
1-1⁄2 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
1 bay leaf  
Pinch cayenne pepper  
15 no-boil lasagna noodles  
8 ounces fontina cheese, shredded (2 cups)  
3 ounces Gorgonzola cheese, finely crumbled (3⁄4 cup)  
#instructions  
1. Place Gruyère and 1⁄2 cup Parmesan in large heatproof bowl. Combine ricotta, egg, black pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley in medium bowl. Set both bowls aside.  
2. Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add shallot and garlic and cook, stirring often, until shallot is softened, about 2 minutes. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until thoroughly combined, about 1-1⁄2 minutes; mixture should not brown. Gradually whisk in milk and broth; increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil, whisking often. Stir in salt, bay leaf, and cayenne, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until sauce thickens and measures 4 cups, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally and making sure to scrape bottom and corners of pan.  
3. Discard bay leaf. Gradually whisk 1⁄4 cup sauce into ricotta mixture. Pour remaining sauce over Gruyère mixture and stir until smooth.  
4. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Pour 2 inches boiling water into 13 by 9-inch broiler-safe baking dish. Slip noodles into water, 1 at a time, and soak until pliable, about 5 minutes, separating noodles with tip of sharp knife to prevent sticking. Remove noodles from water and place in single layer on clean kitchen towels; discard water. Dry dish and spray lightly with vegetable oil spray.  
5. Spread 1⁄2 cup sauce evenly over bottom of dish. Arrange 3 noodles in single layer on top of sauce. Spread 1⁄2 cup ricotta mixture evenly over noodles and sprinkle with 1⁄2 cup fontina and 3 tablespoons Gorgonzola. Spoon 1⁄2 cup sauce over top. Repeat layering of noodles, ricotta mixture, fontina, Gorgonzola, and sauce 3 more times. For final layer, arrange remaining 3 noodles on top and cover completely with remaining sauce. Sprinkle with remaining 1⁄2 cup Parmesan.  
6. Cover dish tightly with aluminum foil that has been sprayed with oil spray and bake until edges are just bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating dish halfway through baking. Remove foil and turn oven to broil. Broil lasagna until surface is spotty brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Cool lasagna for 15 minutes, then sprinkle with remaining 2 teaspoons parsley and serve.  
FOUR-CHEESE LASAGNA WITH ARTICHOKES AND PROSCIUTTO

Part-skim mozzarella can also be used in this recipe, but avoid preshredded cheese, as it does not melt well. We prefer kosher salt because it clings best to the eggplant. If using table salt, reduce salt amounts by half. To make assembly easier, the roasted vegetable filling can be made and stored in the refrigerator for up to a day.

1 large egg  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
2 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated (1 cup)  
8 ounces Italian fontina cheese, shredded (2 cups)  
12 no-boil lasagna noodles  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE SAUCE: Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot. Fill large bowl with ice water. Add spinach and 1 tablespoon salt to boiling water and cook, stirring often until spinach is just wilted, about 5 seconds. Remove spinach with slotted spoon, transfer to ice water, and soak until completely cool, about 1 minute; drain spinach and transfer to clean kitchen towel. Wrap towel tightly around spinach to form ball and wring until dry. Chop spinach and set aside.  
2. Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add shallots and garlic and cook, stirring often, until shallots are softened, about 4 minutes. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until thoroughly combined, about 1-1⁄2 minutes; mixture should not brown. Gradually whisk in milk; increase heat to medium high and bring to boil, whisking often. Stir in bay leaves, nutmeg, 1⁄2 teaspoon salt, and pepper, reduce heat to low, and simmer, whisking occasionally, for 10 minutes. Discard bay leaves, then whisk in Parmesan until completely melted. Measure out and reserve 1⁄2 cup sauce in small bowl; press plastic wrap directly against surface, and set aside. Transfer remaining sauce to separate bowl and stir in chopped spinach, mixing well to break up any clumps; press plastic directly against surface, and set aside.  
3. FOR THE CHEESE FILLING: Process cottage cheese, egg, and salt in food processor until very smooth, about 30 seconds.  
4. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Pour 2 inches boiling water into 13 by 9-inch broiler-safe baking dish.

BRAISED BELGIAN ENDIVES  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1⁄2 teaspoon sugar  
Salt and pepper  
4 heads Belgian endive (4 ounces each), halved lengthwise  
1⁄4 cup dry white wine  
1⁄4 cup low-sodium chicken broth  
1⁄2 teaspoon minced fresh thyme  
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley  
1 teaspoon lemon juice  
#instructions  
1. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in 12-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle sugar and 1⁄4 teaspoon salt evenly in skillet and set endives, cut sides down, in single layer. Cook, shaking skillet occasionally to prevent sticking, until golden brown, about 5 minutes (reduce heat if endives brown too quickly). Turn endives over and cook until curved sides are golden brown, about 3 minutes longer. Carefully turn endives cut sides down. Add wine, broth, and thyme and reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer, checking occasionally, until leaves open up slightly and endives are tender throughout when poked with paring knife, 13 to 15 minutes (add 2 tablespoons water during cooking if pan appears dry). Transfer endives to warmed serving platter and set aside.  
2. Increase heat to medium-high and bring liquid in skillet to boil; reduce heat and simmer until reduced to syrupy consistency, 1 to 2 minutes. Off heat, whisk in remaining 1 tablespoon butter, parsley, and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste, spoon sauce over endives, and serve immediately.  
BRAISED BELGIAN ENDIVES WITH BACON AND CREAM  
Cook 3 slices bacon, cut into 1⁄4-inch pieces, in 12-inch skillet over medium heat until crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer bacon to paper towel–lined plate and set aside. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from skillet. Substitute rendered fat for butter when browning endives in step 1, and substitute 2 tablespoons heavy cream for butter in step 2. Omit lemon juice. Sprinkle sauced endives with reserved bacon and serve.  
CIDER-BRAISED BELGIAN ENDIVES WITH APPLES  
Because the apples absorb some of the braising liquid, more cider is added to the pan before the sauce is reduced.  
Add 1 Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored, and cut into 1⁄4-inch-thick wedges, to skillet with endives. Substitute 1⁄2 cup apple cider for chicken broth and wine. Remove apples from skillet along with endives at end of step 1, then add 2 tablespoons more cider to skillet and continue with recipe from step 2, omitting lemon juice.

8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
1 cup half-and-half, warmed  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons salt  
Pepper  
#instructions  
1. Place potatoes in large saucepan and cover with 1 inch cold water. Bring to boil over high heat, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until potatoes are just tender (paring knife can be slipped in and out of potatoes with little resistance), 20 to 30 minutes. Drain.  
2. Set ricer or food mill over now-empty saucepan. Using potholder (to hold potatoes) and paring knife, peel skins from potatoes. Working in batches, cut peeled potatoes into large chunks and press or mill into saucepan.  
3. Stir in butter until incorporated. Gently whisk in half-and-half, add salt, and season with pepper to taste. Serve.  
GARLIC MASHED POTATOES  
Avoid using unusually large garlic cloves, which will not soften adequately during toasting. For chunky mashed potatoes, use a potato masher, decrease the half-and-half to 3⁄4 cup, and mash the garlic to a paste with a fork before you add it to the potatoes.  
Toast 22 unpeeled garlic cloves (about 3 ounces, or 2⁄3 cup), covered, in 8-inch skillet over low heat, shaking pan frequently, until cloves are dark spotty brown and slightly softened, about 22 minutes. Off heat, let sit, covered, until fully softened, 15 to 20 minutes. Peel cloves and, with paring knife, cut off woody root end; set aside. Press or mill garlic along with potatoes in step 2.  
GARLIC MASHED POTATOES WITH SMOKED GOUDA AND CHIVES  
Reduce salt to 1-1⁄4 teaspoons and stir in 4 ounces grated smoked Gouda cheese (1 cup) along with half-and-half; set pot over low heat and stir until cheese is melted and incorporated. Stir in 3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives.

Whisk 2 tablespoons prepared horseradish, 1⁄4 cup grated fresh horseradish, and 3 minced scallions, green parts only, into warm half-and-half. Add mixture to potatoes and stir until just combined. Serve immediately.  
MASHED POTATOES WITH SMOKED CHEDDAR AND GRAINY MUSTARD  
After stirring butter into potatoes in step 3, season with 1-1⁄4 teaspoons salt and 1⁄2 teaspoon pepper. Add 2 tablespoons whole grain mustard and 3 ounces grated smoked cheddar cheese (3⁄4 cup) with half-and-half, and stir until just combined. Serve immediately.  
MASHED POTATOES WITH SMOKED PAPRIKA AND TOASTED GARLIC  
Don’t be deterred by the extra steps in these mashed potatoes—they are worth the trouble.  
While potatoes are simmering, toast 1 teaspoon smoked paprika in 8-inch skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer to small bowl; set aside. Melt 8 tablespoons butter in small saucepan over medium-low heat. Add 3 minced garlic cloves, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring frequently, until garlic begins to brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat immediately and set aside for 5 minutes (garlic will continue to brown). Pour butter-garlic mixture through mesh strainer; reserve butter and set toasted garlic aside. Rice or mill potatoes as directed, then stir butter into potatoes until just incorporated. Season potatoes with toasted paprika, 1-1⁄2 teaspoons salt, and 1⁄2 teaspoon pepper.

TWICE-BAKED POTATOES  
#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
To vary the flavor a bit, try substituting other types of cheese, such as Gruyère, fontina, or feta, for the cheddar. Yukon Gold potatoes, though slightly more moist than our ideal, can be substituted for the russets.  
4 russet potatoes (7 to 8 ounces each), rubbed lightly with vegetable oil  
4 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (1 cup)  
1⁄2 cup sour cream  
1⁄2 cup buttermilk  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature  
3 scallions, sliced thin  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
Pepper  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Bake potatoes on aluminum foil–lined baking sheet until skin is crisp and deep brown and paring knife easily pierces flesh, about 1 hour. Transfer potatoes to wire rack and let sit until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes; set baking sheet aside.  
2. Using oven mitt or folded kitchen towel to handle hot potatoes, cut each potato in half lengthwise. Using soupspoon, scoop flesh from each half into medium bowl, leaving 1⁄8- to 1⁄4-inch thickness of flesh in each shell. Return potato shells, cut side up, to foil-lined baking sheet and return to oven until dry and slightly crisped, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, mash potato flesh with fork until smooth. Stir in cheese, sour cream, buttermilk, butter, scallions, salt, and pepper to taste until well combined.  
3. Remove shells from oven and heat broiler. Holding shells steady on pan with oven mitt or towel-protected hand, spoon mashed potato mixture into crisped shells, mounding slightly at the center. Return potatoes to oven and broil until spotty brown and crisp on top, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes. Serve warm.

1-1⁄2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and sliced crosswise into 1⁄4-inch-thick rounds  
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper  
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley  
#instructions  
1. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, add onion and 1⁄4 teaspoon salt, and stir to coat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion begins to soften, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until onion is light brown and soft, about 12 minutes longer, deglazing with water when pan gets dry, about halfway through cooking time. Transfer to bowl and cover. (Do not wash skillet.)  
2. While onion cooks, microwave 1 tablespoon butter in large bowl until melted, about 20 seconds. Add potatoes and toss to coat with melted butter.

5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
1 tablespoon cornstarch  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary (optional)  
1 teaspoon salt  
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Place potatoes in large bowl and fill with cold water. Using hands, swirl to remove excess starch, drain, then spread potatoes onto kitchen towels and dry thoroughly.

POTATOES  
7 pounds sweet potatoes  
STREUSEL  
5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 5 pieces and softened, plus extra for pan  
1⁄2 cup (2-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄2 cup packed (3-1⁄2 ounces) dark brown sugar  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1 cup pecans  
FILLING  
5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
1 tablespoon vanilla extract  
4 teaspoons lemon juice  
2 teaspoons salt  
1⁄2 teaspoon ground nutmeg  
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper  
Granulated sugar  
4 large egg yolks  
1-1⁄2 cups half-and-half  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE POTATOES: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Poke sweet potatoes several times with paring knife and space evenly on aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet. Bake potatoes, turning once, until they are very tender and can be squeezed easily with tongs, 1 to 1-1⁄2 hours (or 45 minutes for small sweet potatoes). Remove potatoes from oven and cut in half lengthwise to let steam escape; cool at least 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees.  
2. FOR THE STREUSEL: While potatoes are baking, butter 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Pulse flour, brown sugar, and salt in food processor until blended, about 4 pulses. Sprinkle butter pieces over flour mixture and pulse until crumbly mass forms, 6 to 8 pulses. Sprinkle nuts over mixture and pulse until combined but some large nut pieces remain, 4 to 6 pulses. Transfer streusel to medium bowl and return now-empty workbowl to processor.

Kosher salt and pepper  
8 slices hearty white sandwich bread, torn into quarters  
2 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated (1 cup)  
1 cup all-purpose flour  
4 large eggs  
6 tablespoons vegetable oil  
SAUCE  
3 (14.5-ounce) cans diced tomatoes  
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  
4 garlic cloves, minced  
1⁄4 teaspoon red pepper flakes  
1⁄4 cup chopped fresh basil  
Kosher salt and pepper  
8 ounces whole-milk or part-skim mozzarella, shredded (2 cups)  
1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated (1⁄2 cup)  
10 fresh basil leaves, roughly torn  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE EGGPLANT: Line baking sheet with triple layer of paper towels and set aside. Toss eggplant and 1-1⁄2 teaspoons salt together in bowl, then transfer to colander. Let sit until eggplant releases about 2 tablespoons liquid, 30 to 45 minutes. Wipe excess salt from eggplant, then arrange on prepared baking sheet. Cover with another triple layer of paper towels and firmly press each slice to remove as much liquid as possible.  
2. While eggplant is draining, adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions, place rimmed baking sheet on each rack, and heat oven to 425 degrees. Pulse bread in food processor to fine, even crumbs, about 15 pulses (you should have about 4 cups). Transfer crumbs to pie plate or shallow dish and stir in Parmesan, and 1⁄2 teaspoon pepper; set aside. Wipe out food processor bowl (do not wash) and set aside.  
3. Combine flour and 1 teaspoon pepper in large zipper-lock bag and shake to combine. Beat eggs in second pie plate or shallow dish. Place 8 to 10 eggplant slices in bag with flour, seal bag, and shake to coat eggplant. Remove eggplant slices, shaking off excess flour, then dip in eggs, letting excess egg run off. Then coat evenly with bread-crumb mixture. Set breaded slices on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining eggplant.  
4. Remove preheated baking sheets from oven. Add 3 tablespoons oil to each sheet, tilting to coat evenly with oil. Place half of breaded eggplant on each baking sheet in single layer; bake until eggplant is well browned and crisp, about 30 minutes, switching and rotating baking sheets after 10 minutes, and flipping eggplant slices with wide spatula after 20 minutes. (Do not turn off oven.)  
5. FOR THE SAUCE: While eggplant bakes, process 2 cans diced tomatoes in food processor until almost smooth, about 5 seconds. Heat olive oil, garlic, and pepper flakes in large saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and garlic is light golden, about 3 minutes. Stir in processed tomatoes and remaining can diced tomatoes. Bring sauce to boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened and reduced, about 15 minutes (you should have about 4 cups). Stir in basil and season with salt and pepper to taste.  
6. TO ASSEMBLE: Spread 1 cup tomato sauce over bottom of 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Layer in half of eggplant slices, overlapping slices to fit. Distribute 1 cup sauce over eggplant, then sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella. Layer in remaining eggplant, then dot with 1 cup sauce, leaving majority of eggplant exposed so it will remain crisp. Sprinkle with Parmesan and remaining 1 cup mozzarella. Bake until bubbling and cheese is browned, 13 to 15 minutes. Cool 10 minutes, scatter basil over top, and serve, passing remaining tomato sauce separately.

5 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded (1-1⁄4 cups)  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley  
1⁄4 cup ketchup  
#instructions  
1. Bring 4 quarts water to boil in Dutch oven over high heat. Add bell peppers and 1 tablespoon salt. Cook until peppers just begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, remove peppers from pot, drain off excess water, and place peppers, cut side up, on large paper towel–lined plate. Return water to boil, add rice, and boil until tender, about 13 minutes. Drain rice, then transfer to large bowl; set aside.  
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees.  
3. Meanwhile, heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add ground beef and cook, breaking beef into small pieces with spoon, until no longer pink, about 4 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer mixture to bowl with rice, stir in tomatoes, 1 cup cheese, and parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste.  
4. Combine ketchup and reserved tomato juice in small bowl. Place peppers, cut side up, in 9-inch square baking dish. Using soupspoon, divide filling evenly among peppers. Spoon 2 tablespoons ketchup mixture over each filled pepper and sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon cheese. Bake until cheese is browned and filling is heated through, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve immediately.  
STUFFED BELL PEPPERS WITH CHICKEN, SMOKED MOZZARELLA, AND BASIL  
Substitute 12 ounces ground chicken for beef, cooking until opaque in step 3, about 4 minutes. Substitute 4 ounces smoked shredded mozzarella cheese (about 1 cup) for the Monterey Jack, adding all 4 ounces to rice mixture in step 3, and substitute 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil for parsley. Do not reserve any juice when draining diced tomatoes and omit ketchup. Instead, pulse 1 slice hearty white sandwich bread, crust removed, and bread torn into quarters, in food processor to coarse crumbs, about 10 pulses. Sprinkle stuffed peppers with bread crumbs before baking.  
STUFFED BELL PEPPERS WITH SPICED LAMB, CURRANTS, AND FETA CHEESE

Stir in 1⁄4 cup currants and 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger with garlic in step 3. Substitute 4 ounces crumbled feta (1 cup) for Monterey Jack, adding all 4 ounces to rice mixture in step 3, and substitute 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro for parsley. Do not reserve any juice when draining diced tomatoes and omit ketchup. Instead, spoon 1⁄3 cup chopped, toasted salted cashews over filled peppers before baking.  
KEEPING STUFFED PEPPERS UPRIGHT  
Your peppers should fit snuggly inside of the baking dish and remain upright, but here are some alternatives if you don’t have the right size bakeware.  
A. Place stuffed peppers in a tube pan, where they will snuggly fit.  
B. Place stuffed peppers in a muffin tin—the cups of the tin will hold the peppers firmly.  
C. Place each stuffed pepper in an individual ovensafe ramekin. This is also a great system if you want to cook just a few at a time.

ULTIMATE VEGGIE BURGERS  
#quantity  
MAKES 12 BURGERS  
#ingredients  
3⁄4 cup dried brown lentils, picked over and rinsed  
2-1⁄2 teaspoons salt  
3⁄4 cup bulgur  
1⁄4 cup vegetable oil  
2 onions, chopped fine  
1 celery rib, chopped fine  
1 small leek, white and light green parts only, halved lengthwise, chopped fine, and washed thoroughly  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
1 pound cremini or white mushrooms, trimmed and sliced 1⁄4 inch thick  
1 cup raw cashews  
1⁄3 cup mayonnaise  
2 cups panko bread crumbs  
Pepper  
12 hamburger rolls  
#instructions  
1. Bring 3 cups water, lentils, and 1 teaspoon salt to boil in medium saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until lentils are just beginning to fall apart, about 25 minutes. Drain in fine-mesh strainer. Line baking sheet with triple layer of paper towels and spread drained lentils over paper towels. Gently pat lentils dry with additional paper towels. Cool lentils to room temperature.  
2. While lentils simmer, bring 2 cups water and 1⁄2 teaspoon salt to boil in small saucepan. Stir bulgur into boiling water and cover immediately; let sit off heat until water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain in fine-mesh strainer, then use rubber spatula to press out excess moisture. Transfer bulgur to medium bowl and set aside.  
3. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions, celery, leek, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Spread vegetable mixture onto second baking sheet to cool; set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Spread mushrooms on baking sheet with vegetable mixture; cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.  
4. Process cashews in food processor until finely chopped, about 15 pulses (do not wash workbowl). Stir cashews into bowl with bulgur, then stir in cooled lentils, vegetable-mushroom mixture, and mayonnaise. Transfer half of mixture to now-empty food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped, 15 to 20 pulses (mixture should be cohesive but roughly textured). Transfer processed mixture to large bowl and repeat with remaining unprocessed mixture; combine with first batch.  
5. Stir in panko and remaining 1 teaspoon salt and season with pepper to taste. Line baking sheet with paper towels. Divide mixture into 12 portions, about 1⁄2 cup each, shaping each into tightly packed patty about 4 inches in diameter and 1⁄2 inch thick. Place patties on prepared baking sheet (paper towels will absorb excess moisture).  
6A. FOR THE STOVETOP: Heat remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Cook burgers, 4 at a time, until well browned, about 4 minutes per side (if browning too quickly, lower heat to medium). Repeat with additional oil and burgers. Serve. (Cooked burgers can be kept warm in 250-degree oven for up to 30 minutes.)  
6B. FOR THE GRILL: For charcoal grill, open bottom vent halfway. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent halfway. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes. For gas grill, turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Clean and oil cooking grate. Grill burgers, without moving them, until well browned, about 5 minutes; flip burgers and continue cooking until well browned on second side, about 5 minutes. Serve.  
TO MAKE AHEAD: Patties can be prepared through step 5 and refrigerated for up to 3 days. Alternatively, you can freeze patties. For each burger to be frozen, add 1 teaspoon panko bread crumbs or 1⁄2 teaspoon plain bread crumbs to mixture before shaping. Thaw frozen patties overnight in refrigerator on triple layer of paper towels, covered loosely. Before cooking, pat patties dry with paper towels and reshape to make sure they are tightly packed and cohesive.

2 tablespoons minced fresh dill  
3 garlic cloves, minced  
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest plus 1 tablespoon juice  
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg  
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
PHYLLO LAYERS  
7 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
8 ounces (14 by 9-inch) phyllo, thawed  
1-1⁄2 ounces Pecorino Romano cheese, grated (3⁄4 cup)  
2 teaspoons sesame seeds (optional)  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE FILLING: Place spinach and water in large bowl. Cover bowl with large dinner plate (plate should completely cover bowl and not rest on spinach). Microwave until spinach is wilted and decreased in volume by half, about 5 minutes. Remove bowl from microwave and keep covered for 1 minute. Carefully remove plate and transfer spinach to colander. Using back of rubber spatula, gently press spinach against colander to release excess liquid. Transfer spinach to cutting board and chop coarse. Transfer spinach to clean kitchen towel and squeeze to remove excess water. Place drained spinach in large bowl. Add remaining filling ingredients and mix until thoroughly combined.  
2. FOR THE PHYLLO LAYERS: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Using pastry brush, lightly brush 14 by 9-inch rectangle in center of parchment with melted butter to cover area same size as phyllo. Lay 1 phyllo sheet on buttered parchment and brush thoroughly with melted butter. Repeat with 9 more phyllo sheets, brushing each with butter (you should have total of 10 layers of phyllo).  
3. Spread spinach mixture evenly over phyllo, leaving 1⁄4-inch border on all sides. Cover spinach with 6 more phyllo sheets, brushing each with butter and sprinkling each with about 2 tablespoons Pecorino cheese. Lay 2 more phyllo sheets on top, brushing each with butter (do not sprinkle these layers with Pecorino).  
4. Working from center outward, use palms of your hands to compress layers and press out any air pockets. Using sharp knife, score spanakopita through top 3 layers of phyllo into 24 equal pieces. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, if using. Bake until phyllo is golden and crisp, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on baking sheet 10 minutes, or up to 2 hours. Slide spanakopita, still on parchment, onto cutting board. Cut into squares and serve.  
TO MAKE AHEAD: Filling can be made up to 24 hours in advance and refrigerated. Freeze assembled, unbaked spanakopita on baking sheet, wrapped well in plastic wrap, or cut spanakopita in half crosswise and freeze smaller sections on plate. Bake spanakopita frozen, increasing baking time by 5 to 10 minutes.  
TIPS FOR TAMING PHYLLO  
Frozen packaged phyllo dough functions as light, flaky pastry in traditional Greek dishes such as baklava and spanakopita and as a ready-made tart crust or wrapper for both sweet and savory fillings. But the tendency of these paper-thin sheets to tear, dry out quickly, or stick together can be maddening. Here are some tips for mastering this delicate dough.  
1. To help prevent cracking, phyllo must be kept moist until you’re ready to work with it. The usual approach is to cover the stack with a damp kitchen towel. But it’s all too easy to overmoisten the towel and turn the dough sticky. We prefer to cover the stack with plastic wrap to protect the phyllo and then a damp towel.  
2. Because phyllo is so fragile, some sheets crack and even tear while still in the box. Don’t worry about rips, just make sure to adjust the orientation of the sheets as you stack them so that cracks in different sheets don’t line up.  
3. When phyllo sheets emerge from the box fused at their edges, don’t try to separate the sheets. Instead, trim the fused portion and discard.

VEGETABLE TORTA WITH ASIAGO AND HERBS  
#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8 AS A MAIN COURSE OR 8 TO 10 AS A SIDE DISH  
#ingredients  
VEGETABLES  
3 pounds eggplant, peeled, halved crosswise, and cut lengthwise into 1⁄2-inch-thick slices  
Kosher salt  
3 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra for brushing wire racks  
1 garlic head, outer papery skin removed and top third of head cut off and discarded  
Pepper  
2 red bell peppers  
2 large tomatoes, cored and cut into 1⁄4-inch-thick slices  
4 zucchini, cut 1⁄4 inch thick on steep bias  
CRUST  
4 slices hearty white sandwich bread, torn into quarters  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
2 ounces Asiago cheese, grated fine (1 cup)  
CUSTARD AND GARNISH  
3 large eggs  
1⁄4 cup heavy cream  
2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme  
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice  
3 ounces Asiago cheese, grated fine (1-1⁄2 cups)  
2 tablespoons shredded fresh basil  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE VEGETABLES: Line baking sheet with triple layer of paper towels and set aside. Toss eggplant slices with 1 tablespoon salt in large bowl. Transfer to colander and let drain until eggplant releases about 2 tablespoons liquid, about 30 minutes. Wipe excess salt from eggplant. Arrange eggplant slices in single layer on prepared baking sheet, then cover with another triple layer of paper towels. Firmly press each slice to flatten and remove as much liquid as possible.  
2. While eggplant drains, adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 450 degrees. Set 2 wire racks in 2 rimmed baking sheets and brush both racks with oil. Place garlic, cut side up, on sheet of aluminum foil and drizzle with 1-1⁄2 teaspoons oil. Wrap foil tightly around garlic and set aside. 3. Arrange salted and pressed eggplant slices on oiled racks. Brush slices on both sides with 2 tablespoons oil and season with pepper to taste.  
4. Brush peppers with remaining 1-1⁄2 teaspoons oil and place 1 pepper on each baking sheet with eggplant. Transfer eggplant and peppers to oven, placing foil-wrapped garlic on lower oven rack alongside baking sheet. Roast vegetables until eggplant slices are soft, well browned, and collapsed, and peppers are blistered and beginning to brown, 30 to 35 minutes, rotating baking sheets and turning peppers over halfway through baking time. Transfer peppers to medium bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside; allow eggplant to cool on wire racks. Continue to roast garlic until cloves are very soft and golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Set garlic aside to cool. Reduce oven to 375 degrees.  
5. While vegetables roast, line baking sheet with double layer of paper towels, arrange tomato slices on baking sheet, and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt. Let sit 30 minutes, then cover with another double layer of paper towels and gently press to dry tomatoes.  
6. While tomatoes drain, toss zucchini slices with 1 tablespoon salt in large bowl. Transfer to colander and let drain until zucchini releases about 1⁄3 cup liquid, about 30 minutes. Line large plate with triple layer of paper towels, arrange one-third of zucchini slices on plate, then cover with another triple layer of paper towels and press to dry. Repeat, arranging remaining zucchini in 2 additional layers separated by triple layer of paper towels, and placing triple layer of paper towels on top of final zucchini layer. Place a second plate on top of zucchini and press down firmly to compress. Microwave until zucchini is steaming, about 10 minutes. Using potholders, carefully remove from microwave and let sit 5 minutes; remove top plate.  
7. When peppers are cool, remove skins. Slit peppers pole to pole, discard stem and seeds, and cut each pepper lengthwise into 3 pieces. (Eggplant, garlic, and peppers can be roasted, cooled, and refrigerated separately for up to 1 day before assembly.)  
8. FOR THE CRUST: Pulse bread in food processor to coarse crumbs, about 10 pulses. With processor running, pour in butter and process until combined, about 4 seconds. Add 2⁄3 cup cheese and pulse to combine, about 3 pulses. Transfer mixture to bowl. (Do not wash workbowl.)  
9. Thoroughly grease 9-inch springform pan. Sprinkle 1 cup bread-crumb mixture over bottom of pan and, using flat bottom of measuring cup, press crumbs into even layer. Holding pan upright, press additional 1-1⁄4 cups bread-crumb mixture into sides of pan, forming thick, even layer that stops about 1⁄4 inch from top of pan. Set remaining bread-crumb mixture aside.  
10. FOR THE CUSTARD: Squeeze garlic head at root end to remove cloves from skins. In small bowl, mash cloves with fork, then transfer to food processor. Add eggs, cream, thyme, and lemon juice. Process until thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds.  
11. TO ASSEMBLE AND BAKE: Arrange single layer of eggplant on top of bread-crumb crust, tearing pieces as needed to cover entire bottom surface. Sprinkle evenly with 2 tablespoons cheese. Arrange single layer of zucchini and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons cheese. Repeat with another layer of eggplant and cheese. Layer in all red pepper pieces and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons cheese. Pour half of custard over vegetables, tilting pan and shake gently from side to side to distribute evenly over vegetables and down sides. Repeat layering of eggplant and zucchini, sprinkling each layer with 2 tablespoons cheese (about 4 more layers). Pour remaining custard over vegetables, then tilt and gently shake pan to distribute. Arrange tomato slices starting around perimeter of pan, overlapping to fit, then fill in center with remaining slices. Press down on tomatoes gently with hands. Sprinkle torta with 3 tablespoons reserved bread-crumb mixture (discard any remaining bread crumbs).  
12. Set torta on baking sheet and bake on lower-middle rack until tomatoes are dry, bread-crumb topping is lightly browned, center of torta looks firm and level (not soft or wet), and torta registers 175 degrees, 75 to 90 minutes. Cool torta for 10 minutes on wire rack. Run thin, sharp knife around inside of pan to loosen, then remove springform pan ring. (Baked torta can be refrigerated overnight. Allow the torta to sit at room temperature for about 1 hour before serving.)  
13. TO SERVE: Slide thin metal spatula between crust and pan bottom to loosen. Let sit 20 minutes longer (to serve warm) or cool to room temperature, sprinkle with basil, and cut into wedges.  
ASSEMBLING VEGETABLE TORTA  
1. Press bread-crumb mixture into bottom of pan, then tilt pan upright over bowl and press crumbs against sides of pan.  
2. Layer eggplant into pan without overlapping. Tear slices as needed to fill in gaps.  
3. After adding custard, tilt pan from side to side and shake gently back and forth to ensure even distribution.  
4. Arrange tomatoes in circular pattern on top of torta, partially overlapping.

Be sure to add the broth to the skillet before adding the brandy.  
2 teaspoons vegetable oil  
1 shallot, minced  
1 teaspoon all-purpose flour  
3⁄4 cup low-sodium chicken broth  
1⁄4 cup plus 1 tablespoon brandy  
2 tablespoons heavy cream

SLICING CHICKEN BREASTS INTO CUTLETS  
Cutlets are about half the thickness of boneless, skinless breasts and are called for in many recipes. Rather than buy them already cut, we prefer to make them ourselves—store-bought cutlets are often ragged and they vary widely in size and thickness.  
#instructions  
1. Lay chicken breast flat on cutting board, smooth side facing up. Rest 1 hand on top of chicken and, using sharp chef’s knife, carefully slice chicken in half horizontally.  
2. This will yield 2 thin cutlets between 1⁄4 and 1⁄2 inch thick.

CRISP BREADED CHICKEN CUTLETS  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
If you’d rather not prepare fresh bread crumbs, use panko, the extra-crisp Japanese bread crumbs. The chicken is cooked in batches of two because the crust is noticeably more crisp if the pan is not overcrowded.  
4 (6- to 8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, tenderloins removed, trimmed  
Salt and pepper  
3 slices hearty white sandwich bread, torn into quarters  
3⁄4 cup all-purpose flour  
2 large eggs  
1 tablespoon plus 3⁄4 cup vegetable oil  
Lemon wedges  
#instructions  
1. Cover chicken breasts with plastic wrap and pound to even 1⁄2-inch thickness with meat pounder. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season chicken with salt and pepper.  
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Pulse bread in food processor to coarse crumbs, about 10 pulses; transfer to shallow dish or pie plate. Place flour in second dish. Lightly beat eggs and 1 tablespoon oil together in third dish.  
3. Working with 1 cutlet at a time, dredge in flour, shaking off excess, then coat with egg mixture, allowing excess to drip off. Coat all sides of cutlet with bread crumbs, pressing gently so that crumbs adhere; transfer to prepared wire rack and let sit for 5 minutes.  
4. Heat 6 tablespoons oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Place 4 cutlets in skillet and cook until deep golden brown and crisp on first side, about 3 minutes. Flip cutlets, reduce heat to medium, and continue to cook until deep golden brown and crisp on second side and meat feels firm when pressed gently, about 3 minutes longer. Drain cutlets briefly on paper towel–lined plate, then transfer to clean wire rack set in baking sheet and keep warm in oven. Pour off all oil left in skillet and wipe out with paper towels. Repeat with remaining 6 tablespoons oil and remaining 4 cutlets. Serve with lemon wedges.  
DEVILED CRISP BREADED CHICKEN CUTLETS  
Rub each breast with generous pinch cayenne before dredging in flour. Lightly beat 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, and 2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme into eggs along with oil.  
CRISP BREADED CHICKEN CUTLETS WITH GARLIC AND OREGANO  
Lightly beat 3 tablespoons minced fresh oregano and 8 garlic cloves, minced to paste, into eggs along with oil.  
CRISP BREADED CHICKEN CUTLETS WITH PARMESAN (CHICKEN MILANESE)  
Though Parmesan is the traditional cheese to use in this dish, feel free to substitute Pecorino Romano cheese if you prefer a stronger, more tangy flavor. The cheese is quite susceptible to burning, so be sure to keep a very close eye on the cutlets as they cook.  
Substitute 1⁄4 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese for an equal amount of bread crumbs.

1 tablespoon minced fresh sage plus 8 large fresh leaves (optional)  
8 thin slices prosciutto (3 ounces)  
1⁄4 cup olive oil  
1-1⁄4 cups dry vermouth or dry white wine  
2 teaspoons lemon juice  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces and chilled  
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley  
#instructions  
1. Halve chicken horizontally, then cover chicken halves with plastic wrap and pound to even 1⁄4-inch thickness with meat pounder. Combine flour and 1 teaspoon pepper in shallow dish or pie plate.  
2. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Working with 1 cutlet at a time, dredge in flour mixture, shaking off excess, and transfer to work surface. Sprinkle cutlets evenly with minced sage. Place 1 prosciutto slice on top of each cutlet, covering sage, and press lightly to help it adhere.  
3. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add sage leaves, if using, and cook until leaves begin to change color and are fragrant, about 15 to 20 seconds. Remove sage with slotted spoon and transfer to paper towel–lined plate; set aside.  
4. Place 4 cutlets in now-empty skillet, prosciutto side down, and cook over medium-high heat until golden brown on first side, about 3 minutes. Flip cutlets, reduce heat to medium, and continue to cook until no longer pink and lightly browned on second side, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer cutlets to large platter. Wipe out skillet with paper towels. Repeat with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and remaining 4 cutlets; transfer to platter. Tent loosely with aluminum foil and set aside while preparing sauce.  
5. Pour off all fat left in skillet. Add vermouth, scraping up any browned bits. Bring to simmer and cook until reduced to 1⁄3 cup, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in lemon juice. Reduce heat to low and whisk in butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Off heat, stir in parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour sauce over chicken, place sage leaf on top of each cutlet, if using, and serve immediately.

1. There’s no need to flour the prosciutto before sautéing, just the chicken.  
2. Sprinkling the floured cutlets evenly with minced sage then adding prosciutto distributes flavor evenly.  
3. We skip the typical toothpick and start the cutlets prosciutto side down, which helps the ham stick.

NUT-CRUSTED CHICKEN BREASTS WITH LEMON AND THYME  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
This recipe is best with almonds, but works well with any type of nut. We prefer kosher salt in this recipe. If using table salt, reduce salt amounts by half.  
4 (6- to 8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, tenderloins removed, trimmed  
Kosher salt  
1 cup almonds, chopped coarse  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1 shallot, minced  
1 cup panko bread crumbs  
2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest, zested lemon cut into wedges  
1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme  
1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
1 cup all-purpose flour  
3 large eggs  
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard  
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Using fork, poke thickest half of breasts 5 to 6 times and sprinkle with 1⁄2 teaspoon salt. Transfer breasts to prepared wire rack and refrigerate, uncovered, while preparing coating.  
2. Pulse almonds in food processor until they resemble coarse meal, about 20 pulses. Melt butter in 12-inch skillet over medium heat, swirling occasionally, until butter is browned and releases nutty aroma, 4 to 5 minutes. Add shallot and 1⁄2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring constantly, until just beginning to brown, about 3 minutes.

For the best results, buy similarly sized chicken breasts. If the breasts have the tenderloin attached, leave it in place and follow the upper range of baking time in step 1. For optimal texture, sear the chicken immediately after removing it from the oven. We prefer kosher salt in this recipe. If using table salt, reduce salt amounts by half. The chicken can be prepared without the pan sauce; if not making pan sauce, let the chicken rest for 5 minutes before serving in step 2. More pan sauce recipes follow.  
CHICKEN  
4 (6- to 8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed  
2 teaspoons kosher salt  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

While skillet is heating, whisk butter, flour, cornstarch, and pepper together in bowl. Lightly brush top of chicken with half of butter mixture. Place chicken in skillet, coated side down, and cook until browned, about 4 minutes. While chicken browns, brush with remaining butter mixture. Flip chicken, reduce heat to medium, and cook until second side is browned and chicken registers 160 degrees, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer chicken to large plate and let rest while preparing sauce (if not making pan sauce, let chicken rest for 5 minutes before serving).  
3. FOR THE PAN SAUCE: Add shallot to now-empty skillet and cook over medium heat until softened, about 2 minutes. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds.

For the best results, buy similarly sized chicken breasts. Real maple syrup is preferable to imitation syrup, and “mild” or “original” molasses is preferable to darker, more bitter types. Use a rasp-style grater or the fine holes of a box grater to grate the onion. Broiling times may differ from one oven to another, so we recommend checking the chicken after 3 minutes of broiling.  
1 cup ketchup  
3 tablespoons molasses  
3 tablespoons cider vinegar  
2 tablespoons finely grated onion  
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce  
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard  
2 tablespoons maple syrup  
1 teaspoon chili powder  
1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
4 (6- to 8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed  
Salt and pepper  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Whisk ketchup, molasses, vinegar, onion, Worcestershire, mustard, maple syrup, chili powder, and cayenne together in bowl. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.  
2. Heat oil in 12-inch ovensafe skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Lightly brown chicken on both sides, about 2 minutes per side; transfer to plate.  
3. Pour off all oil left in skillet and add barbecue sauce, scraping up any browned bits. Bring to simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring often, until sauce is thick and glossy, and spatula leaves clear trail in sauce, about 4 minutes.  
4. Off heat, return chicken to skillet and coat well with sauce. Turn chicken breasts skinned side up and spoon extra sauce over each piece to create thick coating. Transfer skillet to oven and bake until breasts register 130 degrees, 10 to 14 minutes.  
5. Using potholders (skillet handle will be hot) remove skillet from oven. Adjust oven rack 5 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Broil chicken until breasts register 160 degrees, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer chicken to platter and let rest for 5 minutes.

On the breast pieces, we use toothpicks to secure the skin, which otherwise shrinks considerably in the oven, leaving the meat exposed and prone to drying out. We think the extra effort is justified, but you can omit this step.  
3 tablespoons brown sugar  
2 tablespoons chili powder  
2 tablespoons paprika  
1 tablespoon salt  
2 teaspoons pepper  
1⁄4–1⁄2 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
5 pounds bone-in chicken pieces (split breasts cut in half, drumsticks, and/or thighs), trimmed  
#instructions  
1. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Combine sugar, chili powder, paprika, salt, pepper, and cayenne in bowl.  
2. Using sharp knife, make 2 or 3 short slashes into skin of each piece of chicken, taking care not to cut into meat. Coat chicken with spice mixture, gently lifting skin to distribute spice mixture underneath but leaving it attached to chicken. Transfer chicken skin side up to prepared wire rack (if desired, secure skin of each breast piece with 2 or 3 toothpicks placed near edges of skin). Tent chicken loosely with aluminum foil and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or up to 24 hours.  
3. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Roast chicken until smallest piece registers 140 degrees, 15 to 20 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 500 degrees and continue roasting until chicken is browned and crisp and breast pieces register 160 degrees, 5 to 8 minutes longer. (Smaller pieces may cook faster than larger pieces. Remove pieces from oven as they reach correct temperature.) Continue to roast thighs and/or drumsticks until they register 170 degrees, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to wire rack and let cool completely before refrigerating or serving.

#ingredients  
Avoid using kosher chicken in this recipe or it will be too salty. You will need at least a 6-quart Dutch oven for this recipe. Maintaining an even oil temperature is key. If using large chicken breasts (about 1 pound each), cut each breast into 3 pieces. If using smaller breasts (10 to 12 ounces each), cut each breast into 2 pieces.  
8 cups buttermilk  
1⁄2 cup plus 2 tablespoons salt  
1⁄4 cup sugar  
2 tablespoons paprika  
3 garlic heads, cloves separated, peeled, and smashed  
3 bay leaves, crumbled  
3-1⁄2 pounds bone-in chicken pieces (split breasts cut in half, drumsticks, and/or thighs), trimmed  
3–4 cups peanut oil or vegetable shortening  
4 cups all-purpose flour  
1 large egg  
1 teaspoon baking powder  
1⁄2 teaspoon baking soda  
#instructions  
1. Whisk 7 cups buttermilk, salt, sugar, paprika, garlic, and bay leaves together in large container. Add chicken and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours.

STUFFED CHICKEN BREASTS  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
To make butterflying the chicken easier, freeze it for 15 minutes. If the chicken breasts come with the tenderloin attached, pull them off and reserve them to make the puree in step 2. Because the stuffing contains raw chicken, it is important to check its temperature in step 6.  
CHICKEN  
4 (8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, tenderloins removed, trimmed  
3 tablespoons vegetable oil  
10 ounces white mushrooms, trimmed and sliced thin  
1 small leek, white part only, halved lengthwise, sliced thin, and washed thoroughly  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
1⁄2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme  
1 tablespoon lemon juice  
1⁄2 cup dry white wine  
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley  
Salt and pepper  
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth  
SAUCE  
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 2 pieces  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CHICKEN: Slice each chicken breast horizontally, stopping 1⁄2 inch from edges so halves remain attached. Pound between 2 sheets of plastic wrap to even 1⁄4-inch thickness (each cutlet should measure about 8 by 6 inches) with meat pounder. Trim about 1⁄2 inch from long sides of cutlets (about 1-1⁄2 to 2 ounces of meat per cutlet, or total of 1⁄2 cup from all 4 cutlets) to form rectangles that measure about 8 by 5 inches. Transfer chicken cutlets to plate, cover, and refrigerate while making stuffing.  
2. Process all trimmings in food processor until smooth, about 20 seconds. Transfer puree to medium bowl and set aside. (Do not wash food processor bowl.)  
3. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon oil and leek and cook, stirring often, until leek is softened, 2 to 4 minutes. Stir in garlic and thyme and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in 1-1⁄2 teaspoons lemon juice and cook until all moisture has evaporated, about 30 seconds. Transfer mixture to food processor. Add wine to now-empty skillet, scraping up any browned bits. Transfer wine to small bowl and set aside. Rinse and dry skillet.  
4. Pulse mushroom mixture in food processor until roughly chopped, about 5 pulses. Transfer mushroom mixture to bowl with pureed chicken. Add 1-1⁄2 teaspoons parsley, 3⁄4 teaspoon salt, and 1⁄2 teaspoon pepper. Using rubber spatula, fold together stuffing ingredients until well combined (you should have about 1-1⁄2 cups stuffing).  
5. TO ASSEMBLE AND COOK: With thinnest ends of cutlets pointing away from you, spread one-quarter of stuffing evenly over each cutlet with rubber spatula, leaving 3⁄4-inch border along short sides of cutlet and 1⁄4-inch border along long sides. Roll each breast up as tightly as possible without squeezing out filling and place on plate seam side down. Evenly space 3 pieces of kitchen twine (each about 12 inches long) beneath each breast and tie, trimming any excess.  
6. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add chicken bundles and brown on all sides, about 8 minutes per side. Add broth and reserved wine to skillet and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until chicken bundles register 160 degrees, 12 to 18 minutes. Transfer chicken to carving board and tent loosely with aluminum foil.  
7. FOR THE SAUCE AND TO SERVE: While chicken rests, whisk mustard into cooking liquid, scraping up any browned bits. Bring to simmer over high heat and cook until dark brown and measures 1⁄2 cup, 7 to 10 minutes. Off heat, whisk in butter, 1 piece at a time, remaining 1-1⁄2 teaspoons lemon juice, and remaining 1-1⁄2 teaspoons parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove twine and cut each chicken bundle on bias into 6 medallions. Spoon sauce over chicken and serve.  
STUFFING CHICKEN BREASTS  
#instructions  
1. Slice each breast horizontally, stopping 1⁄2 inch from edges so halves remain attached.  
2. After pounding each butterflied chicken breast to uniform 1⁄4-inch thickness, trim about 1⁄2 inch from long sides of each cutlet to form 8 by 5-inch rectangle.  
3. Spread stuffing evenly over each cutlet, leaving 3⁄4-inch border along short sides and 1⁄4-inch border along long sides.  
4. With short side facing you, roll up each cutlet and secure it snugly with kitchen twine.

#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
To make sure that the breasts cook at the same rate, purchase 2 similarly sized whole breasts (not split breasts) with skins fully intact. Whole chicken breasts weighing about 1-1⁄2 pounds work best because they require a cooking time long enough to ensure that the skin will brown and crisp nicely.  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened  
Salt and pepper  
2 (1-1⁄2-pound) whole bone-in chicken breasts, trimmed  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Set wire rack in aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet.  
2. Combine butter and 1⁄4 teaspoon salt in bowl. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Using your hands or handle of wooden spoon, gently loosen center portions of skin covering each breast. Place butter (about 1-1⁄2 teaspoons per breast) under skin, directly on meat in center of each breast. Gently press on skin to distribute butter evenly over meat. Rub skin with oil and season with pepper. Set chicken breasts on prepared wire rack, propping up breasts on rib bones.  
3. Roast until chicken registers 160 degrees, 35 to 40 minutes. Transfer chicken to carving board and let rest for 5 minutes. Carve chicken and serve.  
ROASTED CHICKEN BREASTS WITH HERBS AND PORCINI MUSHROOMS

Mix chopped mushrooms, 1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme, and 1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary into softened butter along with salt.  
ROASTED CHICKEN BREASTS WITH GARLIC, ROSEMARY, AND LEMON  
Mix 2 minced garlic cloves, 2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary, and 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest into softened butter along with salt.  
ROASTED CHICKEN BREASTS WITH CHIPOTLE, CUMIN, AND CILANTRO  
Mix 2 teaspoons minced canned chipotle chile in adobo, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, and 2 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro into softened butter along with salt.  
ROASTED CHICKEN BREASTS WITH OLIVES, PARSLEY, AND LEMON  
Mix 1 tablespoon chopped pitted kalamata olives, 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest, and 2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley into softened butter along with salt.  
PREPARING CHICKEN BREASTS FOR ROASTING

CHICKEN WITH 40 CLOVES OF GARLIC  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
If using kosher chicken, do not brine in step 1, and season with salt as well as pepper. Try not to purchase heads of garlic that contain enormous cloves; if unavoidable, increase the foil-covered baking time to 40 to 45 minutes so that the largest cloves soften fully. A Dutch oven can be used in place of a skillet, if you prefer. Broiling the chicken for a few minutes at the end of cooking crisps the skin, but this step is optional. Serve the dish with slices of crusty baguette for dipping into the sauce and spreading with the roasted garlic cloves. See CUTTING UP A WHOLE CHICKEN for information on cutting up a whole chicken.  
Salt and pepper  
1 (3-1⁄2- to 4-pound) whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces (4 breast pieces, 2 drumsticks, 2 thighs), wings discarded  
3 large garlic heads, cloves separated and unpeeled  
2 shallots, peeled and quartered lengthwise  
5 teaspoons olive oil  
2 sprigs fresh thyme  
1 sprig fresh rosemary  
1 bay leaf  
3⁄4 cup dry vermouth or dry white wine  
3⁄4 cup low-sodium chicken broth  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 2 pieces and chilled  
#instructions  
1. Dissolve 1⁄2 cup salt in 2 quarts cold water in large container. Submerge chicken in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes. Remove chicken from brine and pat dry with paper towels. Season chicken with pepper.  
2. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Toss garlic and shallots with 2 teaspoons oil, 1⁄4 teaspoon salt, and 1⁄4 teaspoon pepper in shallow dish or pie plate; cover tightly with aluminum foil and roast until softened and beginning to brown, about 30 minutes, shaking dish once to toss contents after 15 minutes (foil can be left on during tossing). Uncover, stir, and continue to roast, uncovered, until garlic is browned and fully tender, 10 minutes longer, stirring halfway through cooking. Remove from oven and increase oven temperature to 450 degrees.  
3. Using kitchen twine, tie together thyme sprigs, rosemary sprig, and bay leaf; set aside. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch ovensafe skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place chicken skin side down in skillet and cook until well browned, 6 to 8 minutes, reducing heat if pan begins to scorch. Flip chicken skin side up and continue to cook until lightly browned on second side, about 3 minutes. Transfer chicken to large plate and pour off all fat left in skillet. Off heat, add vermouth, chicken broth, and herb bundle to now-empty skillet, scraping up any browned bits. Set skillet over medium heat, add garlic mixture, then nestle chicken pieces, skin side up, on top of and between garlic cloves.  
4. Transfer skillet to oven and roast chicken until breast pieces register 160 degrees and thighs and drumsticks register 175 degrees, 10 to 12 minutes. If desired, heat broiler and broil chicken to crisp skin, 3 to 5 minutes.  
5. Using potholders (skillet handle will be hot), remove skillet from oven. Transfer chicken to serving platter. Remove 10 to 12 garlic cloves with slotted spoon and reserve. Remove remaining garlic cloves and shallots with slotted spoon and transfer to platter with chicken. Discard herb bundle. Place reserved garlic cloves in fine-mesh strainer. With rubber spatula, push garlic cloves through strainer into bowl; discard skins. Add garlic paste to sauce in skillet and bring to simmer, whisking occasionally to incorporate garlic. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Off heat, whisk in butter. Serve chicken, passing sauce separately.

#ingredients  
If using kosher chicken, do not brine in step 1, and season with salt as well as pepper in step 3. Broiling the fully roasted and quartered chicken skin side up as it sits in a shallow pool of sauce crisps and browns the skin while keeping the meat succulent. If you decide to skip the broiling step, go directly from quartering the chicken to finishing the sauce with lemon juice, butter, and herbs.  
Salt and pepper  
1 (3-1⁄2- to 4-pound) whole chicken, giblets discarded  
2 lemons  
6 garlic cloves, lightly crushed and peeled  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, 2 tablespoons melted and 2 tablespoons cut into 2 pieces and chilled  
1-3⁄4 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley  
1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme  
#instructions  
1. Dissolve 1⁄2 cup salt in 2 quarts cold water in large container. Submerge chicken in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour. Remove chicken from brine and pat dry with paper towels.  
2. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Set V-rack in flameproof roasting pan and lightly spray with vegetable oil spray.  
3. Cut 1 lemon lengthwise into quarters. Place lemon quarters and garlic in cavity of chicken. Brush breast side of chicken with 1 tablespoon melted butter and season with pepper.

ROAST CHICKEN WITH ROOT VEGETABLES  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
If using kosher chicken, do not brine in step 1, and season with salt as well as pepper in step 2. If using a nonstick roasting pan, refrain from turning up the oven to broil when cooking the vegetables and stir them every 5 to 7 minutes to ensure they don’t become too dark. If your broiler does not accommodate a roasting pan, continue to cook the vegetables at 500 degrees until done. We prefer to use small red potatoes in this recipe. Use potatoes that are 1-1⁄2 to 2-inches in diameter; larger potatoes should be cut into halves or quarters. You can substitute the following seasonal vegetables for any of those in the recipe: beets, celery root, fennel, rutabagas, and turnips; peel these vegetables (except for the fennel) and cut them into 2- to 3-inch pieces.  
CHICKEN  
1⁄2 cup salt  
1⁄2 cup sugar  
2 garlic heads, cloves separated and lightly crushed  
6 bay leaves, crumbled

Tuck chicken wings behind back and season chicken with pepper. Place chicken wing side up on prepared V-rack and roast for 30 minutes. Remove pan from oven and, using 2 large wads of paper towels, rotate chicken so that other wing side faces up; continue to roast for 30 minutes.  
3. Remove pan from oven and, using 2 large wads of paper towels, turn chicken breast side up. Add broth to pan and continue to roast until chicken is golden brown, breast registers 160 degrees, and thighs register 175 degrees, about 40 minutes. (If pan begins to smoke and sizzle, add additional 1⁄2 cup broth to pan.) Transfer chicken to carving board and let rest while roasting vegetables. Remove V-rack from pan.  
4. FOR THE VEGETABLES: While chicken is resting, adjust oven rack to middle position and increase oven temperature to 500 degrees. Using wooden spoon, scrape browned bits in pan and pour drippings into fat separator. Return now-empty pan to oven and heat until oven reaches 500 degrees, about 5 minutes.  
5. Toss potatoes, carrots, parsnips, and onions with oil, salt, and pepper and scatter in single layer in pan, arranging potatoes and onions cut side down. Roast, without stirring, for 25 minutes.  
6. While vegetables are roasting, measure out and reserve 1⁄2 cup liquid from fat separator; discard remaining liquid and fat (if necessary, add additional broth to make 1⁄2 cup). Remove pan from oven and heat broiler. Drizzle liquid over vegetables and broil, without stirring, for 5 minutes. Stir vegetables, coating well with juices, and continue to broil until tender and deep golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables to serving platter. While vegetables are broiling, carve chicken. Transfer to platter with vegetables and serve.

During first 15 minutes of roasting, toss 1-1⁄2 pounds medium red potatoes, quartered, and garlic with 4-1⁄2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, 1⁄4 teaspoon salt, and 1⁄4 teaspoon pepper in bowl. After chicken has roasted for 15 minutes, scatter potatoes and garlic in single layer in pan; roast for another 15 minutes. Continue with recipe from step 5 as directed, omitting the addition of liquid to pan and stirring potatoes after rotating the chicken; when chicken is done, do not tip V-rack with roast chicken to allow juices to run into pan. While chicken rests, transfer potatoes and garlic to large paper towel–lined plate and pat with additional paper towels. Carve chicken and serve with potatoes and garlic.

GLAZED ROAST CHICKEN  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
For best results, use a 16-ounce can of beer. A larger can will work, but avoid using a 12-ounce can, as it will not support the weight of the chicken. A vertical poultry roaster can be used in place of the beer can, but we recommend only using a model that can be placed in a roasting pan. Taste your marmalade before using it; if it is overly sweet, reduce the amount of maple syrup in the glaze by 2 tablespoons.  
CHICKEN  
1 (6- to 7-pound) whole chicken, giblets discarded  
2-1⁄2 teaspoons salt  
1 teaspoon baking powder  
1 teaspoon pepper  
1 (16-ounce) can beer  
GLAZE  
1 teaspoon cornstarch  
1 tablespoon water, plus extra as needed  
1⁄2 cup maple syrup  
1⁄2 cup orange marmalade  
1⁄4 cup cider vinegar  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter  
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard  
1 teaspoon pepper  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CHICKEN: Place chicken breast side down on cutting board. Use tip of sharp knife to make four 1-inch incisions along back of chicken. Using your fingers, gently loosen skin covering breast and thighs. Using metal skewer, poke 15 to 20 holes in fat deposits on top of breast and thighs. Tuck wings behind back.  
2. Combine salt, baking powder, and pepper in bowl. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and sprinkle evenly all over with salt mixture. Rub in mixture with hands, coating entire surface evenly. Set chicken, breast side up, on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, for 30 to 60 minutes. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 325 degrees.  
3. Open beer can and pour out (or drink) about half of liquid. Place can in middle of roasting pan and spray lightly with vegetable oil spray. Slide chicken over can so drumsticks reach down to bottom of can, chicken stands upright, and breast is perpendicular to bottom of pan. Roast chicken until skin starts to turn golden and breast registers 140 degrees, 1-1⁄4 to 1-1⁄2 hours. Carefully remove chicken and pan from oven and increase oven temperature to 500 degrees.  
4. FOR THE GLAZE: While chicken cooks, stir cornstarch and water together in bowl until no lumps remain. Bring remaining glaze ingredients to simmer in medium saucepan over medium-low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced to 3⁄4 cup, 6 to 8 minutes. Slowly whisk in cornstarch mixture; return to simmer and cook for 1 minute. Remove pan from heat.  
5. When oven has come to temperature, place 1-1⁄2 cups water in bottom of roasting pan and return to oven. Roast until entire chicken skin is browned and crisp, breast registers 160 degrees, and thighs register 175 degrees, 24 to 30 minutes. Check chicken halfway through roasting; if top is becoming too dark, place 7-inch square piece of aluminum foil over neck and wingtips of chicken and continue to roast. (If pan begins to smoke and sizzle, add additional 1⁄2 cup water to pan.)  
6. Brush chicken with 1⁄4 cup glaze and continue to roast until browned and sticky, about 5 minutes. (If glaze has become stiff, return to low heat to soften.) Carefully remove chicken from oven, transfer chicken, still on can, to carving board, and brush with 1⁄4 cup glaze. Let rest for 20 minutes.  
7. While chicken rests, strain juices from pan through fine-mesh strainer into fat separator; allow liquid to settle for 5 minutes. Whisk 1⁄2 cup juices into remaining 1⁄4 cup glaze in saucepan and set over low heat. Using 2 large wads of paper towels, carefully lift chicken off can and onto carving board. Carve chicken, adding any accumulated juices to sauce. Serve, passing sauce separately.

1 (3-1⁄2- to 4-pound) whole chicken, giblets discarded  
#instructions  
1. Process all ingredients except chicken in blender until smooth paste forms, 10 to 20 seconds. Use your fingers to gently loosen skin covering breast and thighs; place half of paste under skin, directly on meat of breast and thighs. Gently press on skin to distribute paste over meat. Spread entire exterior surface of chicken with remaining paste. Tuck wings behind back. Place chicken in 1-gallon zipper-lock bag and refrigerate at least 6 hours or up to 24 hours.  
2. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Place vertical roaster on rimmed baking sheet. Slide chicken onto vertical roaster so drumsticks reach down to bottom of roaster, chicken stands upright, and breast is perpendicular to bottom of pan. Roast chicken until skin just begins to turn golden and breast registers 140 degrees, 45 to 55 minutes. Carefully remove chicken and pan from oven and increase oven temperature to 500 degrees.  
3. Once oven has come to temperature, place 1 cup water in bottom of baking sheet and continue to roast until entire chicken skin is browned and crisp, breast registers 160 degrees, and thighs register 175 degrees, about 20 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through roasting. Check chicken halfway through roasting; if top is becoming too dark, place 7-inch square piece of aluminum foil over neck and wingtips of chicken and continue to roast. (If pan begins to smoke and sizzle, add additional water to pan.)  
4. Carefully remove chicken from oven and let rest, still on vertical roaster, for 20 minutes. Using 2 large wads of paper towels, carefully lift chicken off vertical roaster and onto carving board. Carve chicken and serve, passing Spicy Mayonnaise separately.

HERBED ROAST CHICKEN  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
If using kosher chicken, do not brine in step 1. If you like, substitute an equal amount of basil for the tarragon and replace the thyme with rosemary, oregano, or sage. Do not use dried herbs, which lose potency during cooking and turn the dish gritty. The chicken should not exceed 5 pounds or it won’t fit in the skillet. The chicken may slightly overhang the skillet at first, but once browned it will fit.  
CHICKEN  
1 (5-pound) whole chicken, giblets discarded  
1⁄2 cup plus 1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
6 scallions, green parts only, sliced thin  
1⁄4 cup fresh tarragon leaves  
1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves  
1 garlic clove, minced  
Pepper  
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
SAUCE  
1–1-1⁄2 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour  
1 teaspoon lemon juice  
Salt and pepper  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CHICKEN: Using kitchen shears, cut along both sides of backbone to remove it. Flatten breastbone and tuck wings underneath. Using sharp knife, lightly score skin of thighs and legs, making 2 slashes on each part about 1⁄8 inch into meat and about 3⁄4 inch apart. Dissolve 1⁄2 cup salt in 2 quarts cold water in large container. Submerge chicken in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour.  
2. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Place scallions, tarragon, thyme, garlic, 1⁄4 teaspoon pepper, and remaining 1⁄4 teaspoon salt on cutting board; mince to fine paste. Transfer herb paste to medium bowl, add butter, and mix until combined. Transfer 2 tablespoons herb butter to separate bowl and refrigerate; set aside remainder at room temperature.  
3. Remove chicken from brine and pat dry with paper towels. Using your fingers, gently loosen center portion of skin covering each side of breast; place 1 tablespoon softened herb butter under skin, directly on meat in center of each side of breast. Gently press on skin to distribute butter over meat. Season with pepper.  
4. Heat oil in 12-inch ovensafe skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place chicken skin side down in skillet and reduce heat to medium. Cook until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer skillet to oven and roast chicken for 25 minutes. Using 2 large wads of paper towels, flip chicken skin side up. Using spoon or spatula, evenly coat skin with remaining softened herb butter and return to oven. Roast chicken until skin is golden brown, breast registers 160 degrees, and thighs register 175 degrees, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer chicken to carving board and let rest for 20 minutes.  
5. FOR THE SAUCE: While chicken rests, pour pan juices into fat separator; allow liquid to settle for 5 minutes. Pour juices into 2-cup liquid measuring cup and add enough chicken broth to measure 1-1⁄2 cups. Heat 2 teaspoons fat from fat separator in now-empty skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until golden, about 1 minute. Slowly whisk in broth, scraping up any browned bits. Bring to rapid simmer and cook until reduced to 1 cup, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in any accumulated chicken juices; return to simmer and cook for 30 seconds. Off heat, whisk in cold herb butter and lemon juice and season with salt and pepper to taste. Carve chicken and serve, passing sauce separately.

SERVES 3 TO 4  
#ingredients  
If using kosher chicken, do not brine in step 1, and season with salt as well as pepper in step 3. Because you’ll be cooking the chicken under high heat, it’s important that you rinse it thoroughly before proceeding—otherwise, the sugar remaining on the skin from the brine will caramelize and ultimately burn. For this cooking technique, russet potatoes offer the best potato flavor, but Yukon Golds develop a beautiful color and retain their shape better after cooking. Either works well in this recipe. A food processor makes quick and easy work of slicing the potatoes.  
1 (3-1⁄2- to 4-pound) whole chicken, giblets discarded  
Salt and pepper  
1⁄2 cup sugar  
2-1⁄2 pounds russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and sliced 1⁄8 to 1⁄4 inch thick  
2 tablespoons olive oil  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter or flavored butter (recipes follow), softened  
#instructions  
1. Using kitchen shears, cut along both sides of backbone to remove it. Flatten breastbone and tuck wings behind back. Dissolve 1⁄2 cup salt and sugar in 2 quarts cold water in large container. Submerge chicken in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour.  
2. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 500 degrees. Line broiler-pan bottom with aluminum foil. Toss potatoes with 1 tablespoon oil, 1⁄2 teaspoon salt, and 1⁄4 teaspoon pepper in bowl. Spread potatoes in even layer in prepared broiler-pan bottom and cover with broiler-pan top.  
3. Remove chicken from brine, rinse thoroughly, and pat dry with paper towels. Using your fingers, gently loosen center portion of skin covering breast and thighs. Place butter under skin, directly on meat in center of each side of breast and on thighs. Gently press on skin to distribute butter over meat. Rub skin with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and season with pepper. Place chicken on broiler-pan top and push each leg up to rest between thigh and breast.  
4. Roast chicken until skin has crisped and turned deep brown, breast registers 160 degrees, and thighs register 175 degrees, 40 to 45 minutes, rotating pan halfway through roasting. Transfer chicken to carving board and let rest for 10 minutes.  
5. While chicken rests, remove broiler-pan top and, using paper towels, soak up excess grease from potatoes. Transfer potatoes to serving platter. Carve chicken, transfer to platter with potatoes, and serve.

CHICKEN AND RICE WITH TOMATOES, WHITE WINE, AND PARSLEY  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
Though we rarely suggest stirring rice while it cooks, in this dish it is necessary, or the top layer might dry out or be undercooked. If you prefer, substitute 2 pounds of breast meat or boneless thighs for the pieces of a whole chicken. See CUTTING UP A WHOLE CHICKEN.  
1 (3-1⁄2- to 4-pound) whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces (4 breast pieces, 2 drumsticks, 2 thighs), wings discarded  
Salt and pepper  
2 tablespoons olive oil  
1 onion, chopped fine  
3 garlic cloves, minced  
1-1⁄2 cups long-grain white rice  
2 cups water  
1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained with 1⁄2 cup juice reserved  
1⁄2 cup dry white wine  
1⁄3 cup chopped fresh parsley  
#instructions  
1. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place chicken skin side down in pot and cook until well browned, 6 to 8 minutes, reducing heat if pan begins to scorch. Flip chicken skin side up and continue to cook until lightly browned on second side, about 3 minutes; transfer to plate.  
2. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from pot, add onion, and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently, until coated and glistening, about 1 minute. Stir in water, tomatoes with reserved juice, wine, and 1 teaspoon salt, scraping up any browned bits. Nestle chicken thighs and legs into pot and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Nestle chicken breast pieces into pot and stir ingredients gently until rice is thoroughly mixed; cover and simmer until both rice and chicken are tender, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Stir in parsley, cover, and let dish sit for 5 minutes; serve immediately.  
CHICKEN AND RICE WITH SAFFRON, PEAS, AND PAPRIKA  
Add 1 green bell pepper, cut into 1⁄4-inch pieces, to pot along with onion. Stir 4 teaspoons paprika and 1⁄4 teaspoon saffron into pot along with garlic. Stir 1 cup thawed frozen peas into pot along with parsley.

LATIN-STYLE CHICKEN AND RICE (ARROZ CON POLLO)  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
To keep the dish from becoming greasy, it is important to remove excess fat from the chicken thighs and most of the skin, leaving just enough to protect the meat. To use long-grain rice instead of medium grain, increase the amount of water added in step 3 from 1⁄4 cup to 3⁄4 cup and add the additional 1⁄4 cup water in step 4 as needed. When removing the chicken from the bones in step 5, we found it better to use two spoons rather than two forks; forks tend to shred the meat, while spoons pull it apart in chunks.  
6 garlic cloves, minced  
5 teaspoons white vinegar  
Salt and pepper  
1⁄2 teaspoon dried oregano  
4 pounds bone-in chicken thighs, trimmed  
2 tablespoons olive oil  
1 onion, chopped fine  
1 small green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and chopped fine  
1⁄4 teaspoon red pepper flakes  
1⁄4 cup minced fresh cilantro  
1-3⁄4 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce  
1⁄4 cup water, plus extra as needed  
3 cups medium-grain white rice  
1⁄2 cup green Manzanilla olives, pitted and halved  
1 tablespoon capers, rinsed  
1⁄2 cup jarred whole pimentos, cut into 2 by 1⁄4-inch strips  
Lemon wedges  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Combine garlic, 1 tablespoon vinegar, 1 teaspoon salt, 1⁄2 teaspoon pepper, and oregano in large bowl. Add chicken, coat evenly with marinade, and set aside for 15 minutes.  
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, bell pepper, and pepper flakes and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons cilantro.  
3. Clear center of pot and increase heat to medium-high. Add chicken to center of pot, skin side down, and cook until outer layer of meat becomes opaque, 2 to 4 minutes per side, reducing heat if chicken begins to brown. Stir in broth, tomato sauce, and water. Bring to simmer, cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 minutes.  
4. Stir in rice, olives, capers, and 3⁄4 teaspoon salt and bring to simmer. Cover, transfer to oven, and cook, stirring every 10 minutes, until thighs register 175 degrees, about 30 minutes. If, after 20 minutes of cooking, rice appears dry and bottom of pot begins to scorch, stir in additional 1⁄4 cup water.  
5. Transfer chicken to plate and set pot aside, covered. Pull chicken into large chunks using 2 spoons, discarding skin and bones. Place chicken in large bowl, toss with remaining 2 teaspoons vinegar, remaining 1 tablespoon oil, remaining 2 tablespoons cilantro, and pimentos and season with salt and pepper to taste. Place chicken on top of rice, cover, and let stand until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges.  
LATIN-STYLE CHICKEN AND RICE WITH BACON AND ROASTED RED PEPPERS  
Bacon adds a welcome layer of richness and red peppers bring subtle sweet flavor and color to this variation. To use long-grain rice, increase the amount of water to 3⁄4 cup in step 3 and the salt added in step 4 to 1 teaspoon.  
#instructions  
1. Substitute 2 teaspoons paprika for oregano and sherry vinegar for white vinegar.  
2. Cook 4 slices bacon, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces, in Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove bacon with slotted spoon and transfer to paper towel–lined plate; pour off all but 1 tablespoon bacon fat from pot. Continue with step 2, substituting 1 small red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and chopped fine, and 1 carrot, peeled and chopped fine, for green bell pepper and cooking vegetables in fat left in pot.  
3. Continue with recipe, substituting 1⁄4 cup minced fresh parsley for cilantro, omitting olives and capers, and substituting 1⁄2 cup roasted red peppers, cut into 2 by 1⁄4-inch strips, for pimentos. Garnish chicken and rice with reserved crisp bacon before serving.  
LATIN-STYLE CHICKEN AND RICE WITH HAM, PEAS, AND ORANGE  
Ham gives this variation further richness and orange zest and juice provide a bright accent. To use long-grain rice, increase the amount of water to 3⁄4 cup in step 3 and the salt added in step 4 to 1 teaspoon.  
#instructions  
1. Substitute 1 tablespoon ground cumin for oregano.  
2. Continue with step 2, adding 8 ounces ham steak or Canadian bacon, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces, with onion, bell pepper, and pepper flakes.  
3. Continue with step 3, adding three 3-inch strips orange zest with rice, olives, capers, and salt. Add 1 cup frozen peas to pot with 1⁄4 cup water, if necessary, after stirring contents of pot for second time.  
4. In step 5, toss chicken with 3 tablespoons orange juice along with vinegar, olive oil, cilantro, and pimentos and proceed with recipe.

2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE YOGURT SAUCE: Combine yogurt, garlic, cilantro, and mint in bowl; season with salt and pepper to taste and set aside. (Sauce can be covered and refrigerated for up to 2 days.)  
2. FOR THE CHICKEN AND RICE: Wrap cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, ginger, and cumin seeds in small piece of cheesecloth and secure with kitchen twine. Bring water, spice bundle, and 1-1⁄2 teaspoons salt to boil in medium saucepan. Reduce heat to medium, partially cover, and simmer until spices have infused water, at least 15 minutes (but no longer than 30 minutes).  
3. Meanwhile, pat chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Melt butter in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and cook, stirring often, until soft and dark brown around edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in jalapeños and garlic and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer onion mixture to bowl, season with salt to taste, and set aside. Wipe out skillet with paper towels.  
4. Brown chicken thighs, skin side down, in now-empty skillet over medium-high heat until well browned, 6 to 8 minutes, reducing heat if pan begins to scorch. Flip chicken skin side up and continue to cook until lightly browned on second side, about 3 minutes. Transfer chicken to plate and remove and discard skin. Tent loosely with aluminum foil.  
5. If necessary, return spice-infused water to boil; add rice and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Drain rice through fine-mesh strainer, reserving 3⁄4 cup cooking liquid; discard spice bundle. Transfer rice to medium bowl and stir in saffron and currants (rice will turn splotchy yellow).  
6. Spread half of rice evenly in bottom of now-empty saucepan using rubber spatula. Scatter half of onion mixture over rice, then place chicken thighs, skinned side up, on top of onions; add any accumulated chicken juices. Sprinkle evenly with cilantro and mint, scatter remaining onion mixture over herbs, then cover with remaining rice. Pour reserved cooking liquid evenly over rice.  
7. Cover saucepan and cook over medium-low heat until rice is tender and chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes (if large amount of steam is escaping from pot, reduce heat to low).  
8. Run heatproof rubber spatula around inside rim of saucepan to loosen any affixed rice. Using large serving spoon, spoon biryani into individual bowls, scooping from bottom of pot. Serve, passing yogurt sauce separately.

Place chicken thighs skin side down in pot and cook until well browned, 6 to 8 minutes, reducing heat if pan begins to scorch. Flip chicken skin side up and continue to cook until lightly browned on second side, about 3 minutes. Transfer chicken to plate and remove and discard skin. Tent loosely with aluminum foil.  
2. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from pot, add sausage, and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until browned, about 3 minutes. Remove sausage with slotted spoon and transfer to paper towel–lined plate.  
3. Heat fat left in pot over medium-low heat until shimmering. Add onion, bell pepper, and celery and cook, stirring occasionally and scraping up any browned bits, until vegetables have softened, about 5 minutes. Add rice, 1 teaspoon salt, thyme, and cayenne and cook, stirring often, until rice is coated with fat, about 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes with reserved juice, chicken broth, clam juice, bay leaves, and browned sausage.  
4. Place chicken, skinned side down, on rice and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Stir once, keeping chicken on top with skinned side down. Cover and continue to simmer until chicken is tender and cooked through, about 10 minutes longer; transfer chicken to clean plate and set aside. Scatter shrimp over rice, cover, and continue to cook until rice is fully tender and shrimp are opaque and cooked through, about 5 minutes.  
5. While shrimp are cooking, use 2 forks to shred chicken into bite-size pieces. When shrimp are cooked, discard bay leaves. Off heat, stir in parsley and shredded chicken and serve immediately.

3–4 tablespoons ice water  
FILLING  
1-1⁄2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts or boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed  
2 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
4-1⁄2 teaspoons vegetable oil  
1 large onion, chopped fine  
3 carrots, peeled and sliced 1⁄4 inch thick  
2 small celery ribs, sliced 1⁄4 inch thick  
Salt and pepper  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1⁄2 cup all-purpose flour  
1-1⁄2 cups whole milk  
1⁄2 teaspoon dried thyme  
3⁄4 cup frozen peas, thawed  
3 tablespoons dry sherry  
3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE PIE DOUGH: Process flour and salt in food processor until combined. Scatter shortening over top and pulse until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, about 10 pulses. Scatter butter pieces over top and pulse mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs, about 10 pulses; transfer to large bowl.  
2. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons ice water over flour mixture. Stir and press dough together, using stiff rubber spatula, until dough sticks together. If dough does not come together, stir in remaining 1 tablespoon water.  
3. Turn dough onto sheet of plastic wrap and flatten into 4-inch disk. Wrap dough tightly in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Before rolling out dough, let it sit on counter to soften slightly, about 10 minutes.  
4. FOR THE FILLING: Bring chicken and broth to simmer in covered Dutch oven and cook until chicken is tender and cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer chicken to large bowl. Pour broth through fine-mesh strainer into liquid measuring cup and reserve. Do not wash pot. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees.  
5. Heat oil in now-empty pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, carrots, celery, 1⁄4 teaspoon salt, and 1⁄4 teaspoon pepper and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. While vegetables are cooking, use 2 forks to shred chicken into bite-size pieces. Transfer vegetables to bowl with chicken; set aside.  
6. Melt butter in again-empty pot over medium heat. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in reserved chicken broth, milk, any accumulated chicken juices, and thyme. Bring to simmer and cook until sauce thickens, about 1 minute. Off heat, stir in chicken-vegetable mixture, peas, sherry, and parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste.  
7. Pour chicken mixture into 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Roll dough out to 15 by 11-inch rectangle, about 1⁄8 inch thick, on lightly floured counter. Loosely roll dough around rolling pin and gently unroll it over filling. Trim, fold, and crimp edges, and cut 4 vent holes in top.  
8. Place pot pie on aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet and bake until filling is bubbling on sides and crust is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.  
TO MAKE AHEAD: Dough can be wrapped and refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 1 month. If frozen, let dough thaw completely in refrigerator before rolling out. Chicken filling can be cooled and refrigerated overnight. Reheat filling before transferring to baking dish and proceeding with recipe.

CHICKEN POT PIE WITH SAVORY CRUMBLE TOPPING  
#quantity  
SERVES 6  
#ingredients  
This recipe relies on two unusual ingredients: soy sauce and tomato paste. Do not omit them. They don’t convey their distinctive tastes but greatly deepen the savory flavor of the filling. When making the topping, do not substitute milk or half-and-half for the heavy cream.  
FILLING  
1-1⁄2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts and/or thighs, trimmed  
3 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
1 onion, chopped fine  
3 carrots, peeled and sliced 1⁄4 inch thick  
2 small celery ribs, minced  
Salt and pepper  
10 ounces cremini mushrooms, trimmed and sliced thin  
1 teaspoon soy sauce  
1 teaspoon tomato paste  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1⁄2 cup all-purpose flour  
1 cup whole milk  
2 teaspoons lemon juice  
3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley  
3⁄4 cup frozen peas  
CRUMBLE TOPPING  
2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour  
2 teaspoons baking powder  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper  
1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces and chilled  
1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated fine (1⁄2 cup)  
3⁄4 cup plus 2 tablespoons heavy cream  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE FILLING: Bring chicken and broth to simmer in covered Dutch oven and cook until chicken is tender and cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer chicken to large bowl. Pour broth through fine-mesh strainer into liquid measuring cup and reserve. Do not wash pot. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees.  
2. FOR THE TOPPING: Combine flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, and cayenne in large bowl. Sprinkle butter pieces over top of flour. Using fingers, rub butter into flour mixture until it resembles coarse cornmeal. Stir in Parmesan. Add cream and stir until just combined. Crumble mixture into irregularly shaped pieces ranging from 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 inch each onto parchment paper–lined rimmed baking sheet. Bake until fragrant and starting to brown, 10 to 13 minutes. Set aside.  
3. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, carrots, celery, 1⁄4 teaspoon salt, and 1⁄4 teaspoon pepper; cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender, 5 to 7 minutes. While vegetables are cooking, use 2 forks to shred chicken into bite-size pieces. Transfer vegetables to bowl with chicken; set aside.  
4. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in again-empty pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms; cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms have released their liquid, about 5 minutes. Remove cover and stir in soy sauce and tomato paste. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring often, until liquid has evaporated, mushrooms are well browned, and dark fond begins to form on surface of pan, about 5 minutes. Transfer mushrooms to bowl with chicken and vegetables. Set aside.  
5. Melt butter in again-empty pot over medium heat. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in reserved chicken broth and milk. Bring to simmer, scraping up any browned bits, and cook until sauce thickens, about 1 minute. Off heat, stir in lemon juice and 2 tablespoons parsley, then stir chicken mixture and peas into sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  
6. Pour chicken mixture into 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Scatter crumble topping evenly over filling. Place pot pie on aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet and bake until filling is bubbling and topping is well browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon parsley and serve.

CHICKEN ENCHILADAS WITH RED CHILI SAUCE  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 5  
#ingredients  
If you prefer, Monterey Jack can be used instead of cheddar or, for a mellower flavor and creamier texture, try substituting an equal amount of farmer’s cheese. Be sure to cool the chicken filling before filling the tortillas; otherwise, the hot filling will make the enchiladas soggy.  
SAUCE AND FILLING  
1-1⁄2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
1 onion, chopped fine  
3 garlic cloves, minced  
3 tablespoons chili powder  
2 teaspoons ground coriander  
2 teaspoons ground cumin  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
2 teaspoons sugar  
12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and cut into 1⁄4-inch-wide strips  
2 (8-ounce) cans tomato sauce  
3⁄4 cup water  
1⁄2 cup chopped fresh cilantro  
1⁄4 cup jarred jalapeños, chopped  
8 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (2 cups)  
TORTILLAS AND TOPPINGS  
10 (6-inch) corn tortillas  
Vegetable oil spray  
3 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (3⁄4 cup)  
3⁄4 cup sour cream  
1 avocado, pitted and cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces  
5 romaine lettuce leaves, shredded  
Lime wedges  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE SAUCE AND FILLING: Heat oil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in garlic, chili powder, coriander, cumin, salt, and sugar and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add chicken and cook, stirring constantly, until coated with spices, about 30 seconds. Add tomato sauce and water, bring to simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and flavors have melded, about 8 minutes. Strain mixture through fine-mesh strainer into bowl, pressing on chicken and onion to extract as much sauce as possible; set sauce aside. Transfer chicken mixture to plate; place in refrigerator for 20 minutes to cool, then combine with cilantro, jalapeños, and cheddar in bowl and set aside.  
2. Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees.  
3. TO ASSEMBLE: Spread 3⁄4 cup chili sauce evenly over bottom of 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Place tortillas in single layer on 2 baking sheets. Spray both sides of tortillas lightly with vegetable oil spray. Bake until tortillas are soft and pliable, 2 to 4 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees. Place warm tortillas on counter and spread 1⁄3 cup chicken filling down center of each tortilla. Roll each tortilla tightly and place in baking dish, seam side down. Pour remaining chili sauce over top of enchiladas and spread into even layer so that it coats top of each tortilla. Sprinkle cheddar down center of enchiladas and cover tightly with aluminum foil.  
4. Bake enchiladas on lower rack until heated through and cheese is melted, 20 to 25 minutes. Uncover and serve immediately, passing sour cream, avocado, lettuce, and lime wedges separately.

ENCHILADAS VERDES  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
You can substitute three 11-ounce cans tomatillos, drained and rinsed, for the fresh ones in this recipe. Halve large tomatillos (more than 2 inches in diameter) and place them skin side up for broiling in step 2 to ensure even cooking and charring. If you can’t find poblanos, substitute 4 large jalapeño chiles (with seeds and ribs removed). To increase the spiciness of the sauce, reserve some of the chiles’ ribs and seeds and add them to the food processor in step 4. Be sure to cool the chicken filling before filling the tortillas; the hot filling will make the enchiladas soggy.  
4 teaspoons vegetable oil  
1 onion, chopped medium  
1⁄2 teaspoon ground cumin  
3 garlic cloves, minced  
1-1⁄2 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed  
1-1⁄2 pounds tomatillos (16 to 20 medium), husks and stems removed, rinsed well and dried  
3 poblano chiles, halved lengthwise, stemmed, and seeded  
1–2-1⁄2 teaspoons sugar  
Salt and pepper  
1⁄2 cup chopped fresh cilantro  
8 ounces pepper Jack or Monterey Jack cheese, shredded (2 cups)  
12 (6-inch) corn tortillas  
Vegetable oil spray  
GARNISHES  
2 scallions, sliced thin  
Thinly sliced radishes  
Sour cream  
#instructions  
1. Adjust 1 oven rack to middle position and another rack 6 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until softened and lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in cumin and two-thirds of garlic and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Decrease heat to low and stir in broth. Add chicken, cover, and simmer until it registers 160 degrees, 15 to 20 minutes, flipping chicken halfway through cooking. Transfer chicken to large bowl; place in refrigerator to cool, about 20 minutes. Measure out and reserve 1⁄4 cup broth and set aside; discard remaining liquid.  
2. Meanwhile, toss tomatillos and poblanos with remaining 2 teaspoons oil. Arrange tomatillos cut side down and poblanos skin side up on aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet. Broil on top rack until vegetables blacken and start to soften, 5 to 10 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through broiling.  
3. Remove tomatillos and poblanos from oven, let cool slightly, then remove skins from poblanos (leave tomatillo skins intact). Decrease oven temperature to 350 degrees. Discard foil from baking sheet and set baking sheet aside for warming tortillas.  
4. Transfer vegetables, along with any accumulated juices, to food processor. Add 1 teaspoon sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, remaining garlic, and reserved cooking liquid to food processor and process until sauce is somewhat chunky, about 8 pulses. Season with salt and pepper to taste and adjust tartness by stirring in remaining sugar, 1⁄2 teaspoon at a time; set aside.  
5. When chicken is cool, use 2 forks to shred into bite-size pieces. Combine chicken with cilantro and 1-1⁄2 cups pepper Jack; season with salt to taste.  
6. Spread 3⁄4 cup tomatillo sauce evenly over bottom of 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Place tortillas in single layer on 2 baking sheets. Spray both sides of tortillas lightly with vegetable oil spray. Bake until tortillas are soft and pliable, 2 to 4 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees. Place warm tortillas on counter and spread 1⁄3 cup chicken filling down center of each tortilla. Roll each tortilla tightly and place in baking dish, seam side down. Pour remaining tomatillo sauce over top of enchiladas and spread into even layer so that it coats top of each tortilla. Sprinkle with remaining 1⁄2 cup pepper Jack and cover tightly with foil.  
7. Bake enchiladas on lower rack until heated through and cheese is melted, 15 to 20 minutes. Uncover, sprinkle with scallions, and serve immediately, passing radishes and sour cream separately.

SAUTÉED TURKEY CUTLETS WITH HONEY-MUSTARD PAN SAUCE  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
One cutlet per person makes a skimpy serving, so we call for a total of six to serve four people. If you prefer, replace the Honey-Mustard Pan Sauce with Warm-Spiced Pan Sauce with Currants and Almonds. The turkey can be prepared without the pan sauce; if not making a pan sauce, let the turkey rest for 5 minutes before serving in step 2.  
TURKEY  
6 (4-ounce) turkey cutlets, trimmed

SERVES 8 TO 10  
#ingredients  
Many supermarkets are now selling “hotel-style” turkey breasts. Try to avoid these if you can, as they still have the wings and rib cage attached. If this is the only type of breast you can find, you will need to remove the wings and cut away the rib cage with kitchen shears before proceeding with the recipe. If using a self-basting turkey or kosher turkey, do not brine in step 1.  
1⁄2 cup salt  
1 (6- to 7-pound) whole bone-in turkey breast, trimmed  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened  
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper  
#instructions  
1. Dissolve salt in 1 gallon cold water in large container. Submerge turkey in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 3 to 6 hours.  
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Set V-rack inside roasting pan and spray with vegetable oil spray. Combine butter and pepper in bowl.  
3. Remove turkey from brine and pat dry with paper towels. Using your fingers, gently loosen center portion of skin covering each side of breast; place butter mixture under skin, directly on meat in center of each side of breast. Gently press on skin to distribute butter mixture over meat. Place turkey skin side up on prepared V-rack and add 1 cup water to pan.  
4. Roast turkey for 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees and continue to roast until turkey registers 160 degrees, about 1 hour longer. Transfer turkey to carving board and let rest for 20 minutes. Carve turkey and serve.

If using a self-basting turkey or kosher turkey, do not brine in step 1, and season with salt after brushing with melted butter in step 5. Resist the temptation to tent the roasted turkey with foil while it rests on the carving board. Covering the bird will make the skin soggy.  
1 cup salt  
1 (12- to 14-pound) turkey, trimmed, neck, giblets, and tailpiece removed and reserved for GIBLET PAN GRAVY  
6 sprigs fresh thyme  
2 onions, chopped coarse  
2 carrots, peeled and chopped coarse  
2 celery ribs, chopped coarse  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
1 cup water, plus extra as needed  
1 recipe GIBLET PAN GRAVY  
#instructions  
1. Dissolve salt in 2 gallons cold water in large container. Submerge turkey in brine, cover, and refrigerate or store in very cool spot (40 degrees or less) for 6 to 12 hours.  
2. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Remove turkey from brine and pat dry, inside and out, with paper towels. Place turkey on prepared wire rack. Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 8 hours or overnight.  
3. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Line V-rack with heavy-duty aluminum foil and poke several holes in foil. Set V-rack in roasting pan and spray foil with vegetable oil spray.  
4. Toss thyme and half of vegetables with 1 tablespoon melted butter in bowl and place inside turkey. Tie legs together with kitchen twine and tuck wings behind back. Scatter remaining vegetables in pan.  
5. Pour water over vegetable mixture in pan. Brush turkey breast with 1 tablespoon melted butter, then place turkey breast side down on V-rack. Brush with remaining 1 tablespoon butter.  
6. Roast turkey for 45 minutes. Remove pan from oven; baste turkey with juices from pan. Using 2 large wads of paper towels, turn turkey wing side up. If liquid in pan has totally evaporated, add another 1⁄2 cup water. Return turkey to oven and roast for 15 minutes. Remove turkey from oven again, baste, and rotate so that other wing side is up; roast for another 15 minutes. Remove turkey from oven again, baste, and turn it breast side up; roast until breast registers 160 degrees and thighs register 175 degrees, 30 to 45 minutes.  
7. Remove turkey from oven. Gently tip turkey so that any accumulated juices in cavity run into pan. Transfer turkey to carving board and let rest, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Carve turkey and serve with gravy.

MAKES ABOUT 6 CUPS  
#ingredients  
Complete step 1 up to a day ahead, if desired. Begin step 3 once the bird has been removed from the oven and is resting on a carving board.  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
Reserved turkey neck, giblets, and tailpiece  
1 onion, chopped  
4 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
2 cups water  
2 sprigs fresh thyme  
8 sprigs fresh parsley  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1⁄4 cup all-purpose flour  
1 cup dry white wine  
Salt and pepper  
#instructions  
1. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add neck, giblets, and tailpiece and cook until golden and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir in onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until turkey parts and onion release their juices, about 15 minutes. Stir in broth, water, thyme, and parsley, bring to boil, and adjust heat to low. Simmer, uncovered, skimming any impurities that may rise to surface, until broth is rich and flavorful, about 30 minutes longer. Strain broth into large container and reserve giblets. When cool enough to handle, chop giblets. Refrigerate giblets and broth until ready to use. (Broth can be stored in refrigerator for up to 1 day.)  
2. While turkey is roasting, return reserved turkey broth to simmer in saucepan. Melt butter in separate large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add flour and cook, whisking constantly (mixture will froth and then thin out again), until nutty brown and fragrant, 10 to 15 minutes. Vigorously whisk all but 1 cup of hot broth into flour mixture. Bring to boil, then continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until gravy is lightly thickened and very flavorful, about 30 minutes longer. Set aside until turkey is done.  
3. When turkey has been transferred to carving board to rest, spoon out and discard as much fat as possible from pan, leaving caramelized herbs and vegetables. Place pan over 2 burners set on medium-high heat. Return gravy to simmer. Add wine to pan of caramelized vegetables, scraping up any browned bits. Bring to boil and cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add remaining 1 cup turkey broth, bring to simmer, and cook for 15 minutes; strain pan juices into gravy, pressing as much juice as possible out of vegetables. Stir reserved giblets into gravy and return to boil. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve.  
CARVING A WHOLE ROASTED TURKEY  
#instructions  
1. Remove any twine used to truss turkey. Start by slicing turkey where leg meets breast.  
2. Pull leg quarter away from carcass. Separate joint by gently pressing leg out to side and pushing up on joint, then carefully cut through joint to remove leg quarter.  
3. Cut through joint that connects drumstick to thigh. Repeat on second side to remove other leg. Slice meat off of leg and thigh pieces, leaving a bit of skin attached to each slice.  
4. Pull wing away from carcass and carefully cut through joint between wing and breast to remove wing. Cut wing in half for easier eating.  
5. Cut down along 1 side of breastbone, pulling breast meat away from you as you cut.  
6. Cut breast into attractive slices.

Rotating the bird helps produce moist, evenly cooked meat, but for the sake of ease, you may opt not to rotate it. In that case, skip the step of lining the V-rack with foil and roast the bird breast side up for the entire cooking time. Because we do not brine the bird, we had the best results with a frozen Butterball turkey (injected with salt and water) or a kosher bird (soaked in salt water during processing). Follow illustrations for how to carve the turkey.

GIBLET PAN GRAVY FOR A CROWD  
#quantity  
MAKES ABOUT 8 CUPS  
#ingredients  
Complete step 1 up to a day ahead, if desired. Begin step 3 once the bird has been removed from the oven and is resting on a carving board.  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
Reserved turkey neck, giblets, and tailpiece  
1 onion, unpeeled and chopped  
6 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
3 cups water  
2 sprigs fresh thyme  
8 sprigs fresh parsley  
5 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1⁄4 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour  
1-1⁄2 cups dry white wine  
Salt and pepper  
#instructions  
1. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add neck, giblets, and tailpiece and cook until golden and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir in onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until turkey parts and onion release their juices, about 15 minutes. Stir in broth, water, and herbs, bring to boil, and adjust heat to low. Simmer, uncovered, skimming any impurities that may rise to surface, until broth is rich and flavorful, about 30 minutes longer. Strain broth into large container and reserve giblets. When cool enough to handle, chop giblets. Refrigerate giblets and broth until ready to use. (Broth can be stored in refrigerator for up to 1 day.)  
2. While turkey is roasting, return reserved turkey broth to simmer in medium saucepan. Melt butter in large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add flour and cook, whisking constantly (the mixture will froth and then thin out again), until nutty brown and fragrant, 10 to 15 minutes. Vigorously whisk all but 2 cups of hot broth into flour mixture. Bring to boil, then continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until gravy is lightly thickened and very flavorful, about 35 minutes longer. Set aside until turkey is done.  
3. When turkey has been transferred to carving board to rest, spoon out and discard as much fat as possible from roasting pan, leaving caramelized herbs and vegetables. Place pan over 2 burners set on medium-high heat. Return gravy to simmer. Add wine to pan of caramelized vegetables, scraping up any browned bits. Bring to boil and cook until reduced by half, about 7 minutes. Add remaining 2 cups turkey broth, bring to simmer, and cook for 15 minutes; strain pan juices into gravy, pressing as much juice as possible out of vegetables. Stir reserved giblets into gravy and return to boil. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve.

ROAST SALTED TURKEY  
#quantity  
SERVES 10 TO 12  
#ingredients  
If using a self-basting turkey or kosher turkey, do not salt in step 1, and season with salt after brushing with melted butter in step 5. This recipe was developed and tested using Diamond Crystal kosher salt. If you have Morton’s kosher salt, which is denser than Diamond Crystal, use only 4-1⁄2 teaspoons of salt in the cavity, 2-1⁄4 teaspoons of salt for each half of the breast, and 1 teaspoon of salt per leg. Table salt is too fine and is not recommended for this recipe. If serving with GIBLET PAN GRAVY, note that you can complete step 1 of the gravy recipe up to a day ahead, if desired. Begin step 3 once the bird has been removed from the oven and is resting on a carving board. For information on carving the turkey, see CARVING A WHOLE ROASTED TURKEY.  
1 (12- to 14-pound) turkey, trimmed, neck, giblets, and tailpiece removed and reserved for gravy  
5 tablespoons kosher salt  
1 (5-pound) bag ice cubes  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
3 onions, chopped coarse  
2 carrots, peeled and chopped coarse  
2 celery ribs, chopped coarse  
6 sprigs fresh thyme  
1 cup water  
1 recipe GIBLET PAN GRAVY  
#instructions  
1. Use your fingers or thin wooden spoon handle to gently loosen skin covering breast, thighs, drumsticks, and back of turkey; avoid breaking skin. Rub 2 tablespoons salt evenly inside cavity of turkey, 1 tablespoon salt under skin of each side of breast, and 1-1⁄2 teaspoons salt under skin of each leg. Wrap turkey tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours or up to 48 hours.  
2. Remove turkey from refrigerator. Rinse off any excess salt between meat and skin and in cavity, then pat dry, inside and out, with paper towels. Add ice to two 1-gallon zipper-lock bags until each is half full. Place bags in roasting pan and lay turkey breast side down on top of ice. Add ice to two 1-quart zipper-lock bags until each is one-third full; place 1 bag of ice in large cavity of turkey and other bag in neck cavity. (Make sure that ice touches breast only, not thighs or legs.) Keep turkey on ice for 1 hour (pan should remain on counter).  
3. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Line V-rack with heavy-duty aluminum foil, poke several holes in foil, and spray foil with vegetable oil spray.  
4. Remove turkey from ice and pat dry with paper towels (discard ice). Tuck tips of drumsticks into skin at tail to secure and tuck wings behind back. Brush turkey breast with 2 tablespoons melted butter.  
5. Set V-rack in pan, then scatter vegetables into pan and pour water over vegetable mixture. Place turkey, breast side down, on V-rack. Brush turkey with remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter.  
6. Roast turkey for 45 minutes. Remove pan from oven and reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees. Using 2 large wads of paper towels, rotate turkey breast side up; continue to roast until breast registers 160 degrees and thighs register 175 degrees, 1 to 1-1⁄2 hours longer. Transfer turkey to carving board and let rest, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Carve turkey and serve with gravy.

HERBED ROAST TURKEY  
#quantity  
SERVES 10 TO 12  
#ingredients  
If using a self-basting turkey or kosher turkey, do not brine in step 1. If you have the time and the refrigerator space, air-drying produces extremely crisp skin and is worth the effort. After brining and patting the turkey dry, place the turkey breast side up on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, for 8 to 24 hours. Proceed with the recipe.  
TURKEY AND BRINE  
1 cup salt  
1 (12- to 14-pound) turkey, trimmed, neck, giblets, and tailpiece removed and discarded  
1 recipe ALL-PURPOSE GRAVY

3⁄4 teaspoon grated lemon zest  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1 teaspoon pepper  
1⁄4 cup olive oil  
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE TURKEY AND BRINE: Dissolve salt in 2 gallons cold water in large container. Submerge turkey in brine, cover, and refrigerate or store in very cool spot (40 degrees or less) for 6 to 12 hours.  
2. Remove turkey from brine and pat dry, inside and out, with paper towels. Place turkey, breast side up, on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan and refrigerate, uncovered, for 30 minutes.  
3. FOR THE HERB PASTE: Pulse parsley, thyme, sage, rosemary, shallot, garlic, lemon zest, salt, and pepper together in food processor until coarse paste is formed, 10 pulses. Add oil and mustard; continue to pulse until mixture forms smooth paste, 10 to 12 two-second pulses; scrape bowl with rubber spatula after 5 pulses. Transfer mixture to bowl.  
4. TO PREPARE THE TURKEY: Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Line V-rack with heavy-duty aluminum foil and poke several holes in foil. Set V-rack in roasting pan and spray foil with vegetable oil spray. Remove turkey from refrigerator and wipe away any water collected in baking sheet; set turkey breast side up on baking sheet.  
5. Using your fingers, gently loosen skin covering breast, thighs, and drumsticks. Place 1-1⁄2 tablespoons paste under breast skin on each side of turkey. Gently press on skin to distribute paste over breast, thigh, and drumstick meat.  
6. Using sharp paring knife, cut 1-1⁄2-inch vertical slit into thickest part of each side of breast. Starting from top of incision, swing knife tip down to create 4- to 5-inch pocket within flesh. Place 1 tablespoon paste in pocket of each side of breast; using your fingers, rub paste in thin, even layer.  
7. Rub 1 tablespoon paste inside turkey cavity. Rotate turkey breast side down; apply half of remaining herb paste to turkey skin; flip turkey breast side up and apply remaining herb paste to skin, pressing and patting to make paste adhere; reapply herb paste that falls onto baking sheet. Tuck tips of drumsticks into skin at tail to secure, and tuck wings behind back.  
8. TO ROAST THE TURKEY: Place turkey breast side down on prepared V-rack. Roast turkey for 45 minutes.  
9. Remove pan from oven. Using 2 large wads of paper towels, rotate turkey breast side up. Continue to roast until breast registers 160 degrees and thighs register 175 degrees, 50 to 60 minutes longer. Transfer turkey to carving board and let rest, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Carve turkey and serve with gravy.  
ACHIEVING HERB FLAVOR  
#instructions  
1. Carefully separate skin from meat on breast, thigh, and drumstick areas. Rub herb paste under skin and directly onto flesh, distributing it evenly.  
2. Make 1-1⁄2-inch slit in each breast. Swing knife tip through breast to create large pocket.  
3. Place thin layer of paste inside each pocket, then rub over meat.  
4. Rub remaining paste inside turkey and on skin.  
CARVING AN HERBED ROAST TURKEY  
The wings and legs on our HERBED ROAST TURKEY can be carved just as they would be on any other turkey (1, 2, and 3 “CARVING A WHOLE ROASTED TURKEY”), but the breast, which is stuffed with herb paste, needs some special attention. Here’s how to ensure that every slice has a nice swirl of herbs.  
#instructions  
1. With wings facing toward you, cut along both sides of breastbone, slicing from tip of breastbone to carving board.  
2. Gently pull each breast half away to expose wishbone. Then pull and remove wishbone.  
3. Using knife tip, cut along rib cage to remove breast completely.  
4. Place entire breast half on carving board and cut on bias into thin slices. Repeat step 3 on other side.

ALL-PURPOSE GRAVY  
#quantity  
MAKES 2 CUPS  
#ingredients  
This gravy can be served with almost any type of poultry or meat or with mashed potatoes. If you would like to double the recipe, use a Dutch oven to give the vegetables ample space for browning and increase the cooking times by roughly 50 percent.  
1 small carrot, peeled and chopped  
1 small celery rib, chopped  
1 small onion, chopped  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1⁄4 cup all-purpose flour  
2 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
2 cups beef broth  
1 bay leaf  
1⁄4 teaspoon dried thyme  
5 whole black peppercorns  
Salt and pepper  
#instructions  
1. Pulse carrot in food processor until broken into rough 1⁄4-inch pieces, about 5 pulses. Add celery and onion; pulse until all vegetables are broken into 1⁄8-inch pieces, about 5 pulses.  
2. Melt butter in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add vegetables and cook, stirring often, until softened and well browned, about 7 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until thoroughly browned and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Slowly whisk in chicken broth and beef broth; bring to boil, skimming off any foam that forms on surface. Add bay leaf, thyme, and peppercorns, reduce to simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened and measures 3 cups, 20 to 25 minutes.  
3. Strain gravy into clean saucepan, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve.  
TO MAKE AHEAD: Finished gravy can be frozen for up to 1 month. To thaw either single or double recipe, place gravy and 1 tablespoon water in saucepan over low heat and bring slowly to simmer. Gravy may appear broken or curdled as it thaws, but vigorous whisking will recombine it.

1-1⁄2 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
2 large eggs  
12 ounces salt pork, cut into 1⁄4-inch-thick slices and rinsed  
1 recipe GIBLET PAN GRAVY  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE TURKEY: Use your fingers or thin wooden spoon handle to gently loosen skin covering breast, thighs, drumsticks, and back; avoid breaking skin. Rub 1 tablespoon salt evenly inside cavity of turkey, 1-1⁄2 teaspoons salt under skin of each side of breast, and 1-1⁄2 teaspoons salt under skin of each leg. Wrap turkey tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours or up to 48 hours.  
2. FOR THE STUFFING: Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 250 degrees. Spread bread cubes in single layer on rimmed baking sheet; bake until edges have dried but centers are slightly moist (cubes should yield to pressure), about 45 minutes, stirring several times during baking. (Bread can be toasted up to 1 day in advance.) Transfer dried bread to large bowl.  
3. While bread dries, melt butter in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, celery, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened and lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in thyme, marjoram, and sage and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add vegetable mixture to bowl with dried bread; add 1 cup broth and toss until evenly moistened (you should have about 12 cups stuffing).  
4. Remove turkey from refrigerator and pat dry, inside and out, with paper towels. Using metal skewer, poke 15 to 20 holes in fat deposits on top of breast halves and thighs, 4 to 5 holes in each deposit. Tuck wings behind back.  
5. Increase oven temperature to 325 degrees. Combine remaining 2 teaspoons salt and baking powder in bowl. Sprinkle surface of turkey with salt mixture and rub in mixture with hands, coating entire surface evenly. Line turkey cavity with cheesecloth, pack with 4 to 5 cups stuffing, and tie ends of cheesecloth together. Cover remaining stuffing with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Using kitchen twine, loosely tie turkey legs together. Place turkey breast side down in V-rack set in roasting pan and drape salt pork slices over back.  
6. Roast turkey until breast registers 130 degrees, 2 to 2-1⁄2 hours. Remove pan from oven (close oven door to retain oven heat) and increase oven temperature to 450 degrees. Transfer turkey in V-rack to rimmed baking sheet. Remove and discard salt pork. Using 2 large wads of paper towels, rotate turkey breast side up. Cut twine binding legs and remove stuffing bag; empty into reserved stuffing in bowl.  
7. Once oven has come to temperature, return turkey in V-rack to roasting pan and roast until skin is golden brown and crisp, breast registers 160 degrees, and thighs register 175 degrees, about 45 minutes, rotating pan halfway through roasting. Transfer turkey to carving board and let rest, uncovered, for 30 minutes.  
8. While turkey rests, reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees. Whisk eggs and remaining 1⁄2 cup broth from stuffing recipe together in bowl. Pour egg mixture over stuffing and toss to combine, breaking up any large chunks; spread stuffing into buttered 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Bake until stuffing registers 165 degrees and top is golden brown, about 15 minutes. Carve turkey and serve with stuffing and gravy.

BUTTERFLIED TURKEY WITH CRANBERRY-MOLASSES GLAZE  
#quantity  
SERVES 10 TO 12  
#ingredients  
If using a self-basting turkey or kosher turkey, do not salt in step 1. Table salt is not recommended for this recipe because it is too fine. If you have a V-rack that, when inverted, still fits into your roasting pan, place the turkey on that rather than on the onions. See BUTTERFLYING A CHICKEN OR TURKEY for information on how to butterfly a turkey.  
TURKEY  
1 (12- to 14-pound) turkey, trimmed, neck, giblets, and tailpiece removed and discarded  
Kosher salt and pepper  
2 teaspoons baking powder  
2 large onions, halved  
GLAZE  
3 cups apple cider  
1 cup frozen or fresh cranberries  
1⁄2 cup molasses  
1⁄2 cup apple cider vinegar  
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard  
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 2 pieces and chilled  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE TURKEY: Using kitchen shears, cut along both sides of backbone to remove it. Flatten breastbone and tuck wings underneath. Using your fingers, gently loosen skin covering breast and thighs. Using metal skewer, poke 15 to 20 holes in fat deposits on top of breast and thighs, 4 to 5 holes in each deposit. Rub bone side of turkey evenly with 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Flip turkey skin side up and rub 1 tablespoon salt evenly under skin. Tuck wings under turkey. Push legs up to rest on lower portion of breast and tie legs together with kitchen twine.  
2. Combine 1 tablespoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, and baking powder in bowl. Pat skin side of turkey dry with paper towels. Sprinkle surface of turkey with salt mixture and rub in mixture with hands, coating entire surface evenly. Transfer turkey to roasting pan, skin side up. Place 1 onion half under each breast and thigh to elevate turkey off bottom of roasting pan. Allow turkey to stand at room temperature for 1 hour.  
3. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 275 degrees. Roast turkey until breast registers 160 degrees and thighs register 175 degrees, 2-1⁄2 to 3 hours. Remove pan from oven and allow turkey to rest in pan for at least 30 minutes or up to 1-1⁄2 hours. Thirty minutes before returning turkey to oven, increase oven temperature to 450 degrees.  
4. FOR THE GLAZE: While turkey rests, bring cider, cranberries, molasses, vinegar, mustard, and ginger to boil in medium saucepan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced to 1-1⁄2 cups, about 30 minutes. Strain mixture through fine-mesh strainer into 2-cup liquid measuring cup, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard solids (you should have about 1-1⁄4 cups glaze). Transfer 1⁄2 cup glaze to small saucepan and set aside.  
5. Brush turkey with one-third of glaze in measuring cup, transfer to oven, and roast for 7 minutes. Brush on half of remaining glaze in measuring cup and roast additional 7 minutes. Brush on remaining glaze in measuring cup and roast until skin is evenly browned and crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer turkey to carving board and let rest for 20 minutes.  
6. While turkey rests, remove onions from pan and discard. Strain liquid from pan into fat separator (you should have about 2 cups liquid). Allow liquid to settle for 5 minutes, then pour into saucepan with reserved glaze, discarding any remaining fat. Bring mixture to boil and cook until slightly syrupy, about 10 minutes. Remove pan from heat and whisk in butter. Carve turkey and serve, passing sauce separately.

Instead of drumsticks and thighs, you may use 2 (1-1⁄2- to 2-pound) whole leg quarters. The recipe will also work with a turkey breast alone; in step 2, reduce the butter to 1-1⁄2 tablespoons, the salt to 1-1⁄2 teaspoons, and the pepper to 1 teaspoon. Many supermarkets carry “hotel-style” turkey breasts. Try to avoid these if you can, as they still have the wings and rib cage attached. If this is the only type of breast you can find, you will need to remove the wings and cut away the rib cage with kitchen shears before proceeding with the recipe.  
TURKEY  
3 onions, chopped  
3 celery ribs, chopped  
2 carrots, peeled and chopped  
5 sprigs fresh thyme  
5 garlic cloves, peeled and halved  
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth  
1 (5- to 7-pound) whole bone-in turkey breast, trimmed  
4 pounds turkey drumsticks and thighs, trimmed  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
1 tablespoon salt  
2 teaspoons pepper  
GRAVY  
2 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter  
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour  
2 bay leaves  
Salt and pepper  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE TURKEY: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 275 degrees. Arrange onions, celery, carrots, thyme, and garlic in even layer on rimmed baking sheet. Pour broth into baking sheet. Place wire rack on top of vegetables.  
2. Pat turkey pieces dry with paper towels. Brush turkey pieces on all sides with melted butter and season with salt and pepper. Place breast skin side down and drumsticks and thighs skin side up on rack on vegetable-filled baking sheet, leaving at least 1⁄4 inch between pieces.  
3. Roast turkey pieces for 1 hour. Using 2 large wads of paper towels, turn turkey breast skin side up. Continue roasting until breast registers 160 degrees and thighs register 175 degrees, 1 to 2 hours longer. Remove baking sheet from oven and transfer rack with turkey to second baking sheet. Allow pieces to rest for at least 30 minutes or up to 1-1⁄2 hours.  
4. FOR THE GRAVY: Strain vegetables and liquid from baking sheet through fine-mesh strainer set in 4-cup liquid measuring cup, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids. Add chicken broth to measuring cup (you should have about 3 cups liquid).  
5. Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until flour is dark golden brown and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Slowly whisk in broth mixture and bay leaves and gradually bring to boil. Reduce to simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until gravy is thick and measures 2 cups, 15 to 20 minutes. Discard bay leaves. Off heat, season gravy with salt and pepper to taste. Cover to keep warm.  
6. TO SERVE: Heat oven to 500 degrees. Place baking sheet with turkey in oven. Roast until skin is golden brown and crisp, about 15 minutes. Transfer turkey to carving board and let rest, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Carve and serve with gravy.

BAKED BREAD STUFFING WITH SAUSAGE, DRIED CHERRIES, AND PECANS  
#quantity  
SERVES 10 TO 12  
#ingredients  
Two pounds of chicken wings can be substituted for the turkey wings. If using chicken wings, separate them into 2 sections (it’s not necessary to separate the tips) and poke each segment 4 or 5 times. Also, increase the amount of broth to 3 cups, reduce the amount of butter to 2 tablespoons, and cook the stuffing for only 60 minutes (the wings should register over 175 degrees at the end of cooking). Use the meat from the cooked wings to make salad or soup.  
2 pounds hearty white sandwich bread, cut into 1⁄2-inch cubes (16 cups)  
3 pounds turkey wings, divided at joints  
2 teaspoons vegetable oil  
1 pound bulk pork sausage  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1 large onion, chopped fine  
3 celery ribs, minced  
Salt  
2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme  
2 tablespoons minced fresh sage  
1 teaspoon pepper  
2-1⁄2 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
3 large eggs  
1 cup dried cherries  
1 cup pecan halves, toasted and chopped fine  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 250 degrees. Spread bread cubes in even layer on 2 rimmed baking sheets; bake until edges have dried but centers are slightly moist (cubes should yield to pressure), 45 to 60 minutes, stirring several times during baking. (Bread can be toasted up to 1 day in advance.) Transfer dried bread to large bowl and increase oven temperature to 375 degrees.  
2. While bread dries, use paring knife to poke 10 to 15 holes in each wing segment. Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add wings in single layer and cook until golden brown on both sides, 8 to 12 minutes. Transfer wings to separate bowl and set aside.  
3. Return now-empty skillet to medium-high heat, add sausage, and cook, breaking it up into 1⁄2-inch pieces with wooden spoon, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove sausage with slotted spoon and transfer to paper towel–lined plate.  
4. Melt butter in fat left in skillet over medium heat. Add onion, celery, and 1⁄2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened, 7 to 9 minutes. Stir in thyme, sage, and pepper and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in 1 cup broth, scraping up any browned bits, and bring to simmer. Add vegetable mixture to bowl with dried bread and toss to combine.  
5. Grease 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Whisk eggs, remaining 1-1⁄2 cups broth, 1-1⁄2 teaspoons salt, and any accumulated juices from wings together in bowl. Add egg mixture, cherries, pecans, and sausage to bread mixture and toss to combine; transfer to prepared baking dish. Arrange wings on top of stuffing, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and place baking dish on rimmed baking sheet.  
6. Bake on lower rack until wings register 175 degrees, 60 to 75 minutes. Remove foil and transfer wings to dinner plate to reserve for another use. Using fork, gently fluff stuffing. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.  
BAKED BREAD STUFFING WITH LEEKS, BACON, AND APPLE  
Omit pecans. Substitute 12 ounces bacon, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces, for sausage. In step 3, cook bacon in skillet until crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove bacon with slotted spoon and transfer to paper towel–lined plate; pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from skillet. Proceed with recipe from step 4, substituting 2 leeks, white and light green parts, sliced thin, for onion, and 3 Granny Smith apples, cut into 1⁄4-inch pieces, for dried cherries.  
BAKED BREAD STUFFING WITH FRESH HERBS  
Omit sausage. After browned turkey wings have been removed in step 2, increase butter to 6 tablespoons and melt in skillet over medium heat. Proceed with recipe from step 4, substituting 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley for dried cherries and pecans.

CORNBREAD STUFFING WITH SAUSAGE  
#quantity  
SERVES 10 TO 12  
#ingredients  
To make the stuffing a day in advance, increase both the chicken broth and half-and-half by 1⁄4 cup each and refrigerate the unbaked stuffing 12 to 24 hours; before transferring it to the baking dish, let the stuffing stand at room temperature for about 30 minutes so that it loses its chill.  
12 cups GOLDEN CORNBREAD broken into 1-inch pieces (include crumbs)  
1-3⁄4 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
1 cup half-and-half  
2 large eggs  
12 ounces bulk pork sausage, broken into 1-inch pieces  
3 onions, chopped fine  
3 celery ribs, minced  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter  
2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme  
2 tablespoons minced fresh sage  
3 garlic cloves, minced  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons salt  
2 teaspoons pepper  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 250 degrees. Spread cornbread pieces in even layer on 2 rimmed baking sheets and dry in oven 50 to 60 minutes. Transfer dried cornbread to large bowl and increase oven temperature to 375 degrees.  
2. Whisk broth, half-and-half, and eggs together in medium bowl. Add broth mixture to cornbread and toss very gently to coat so that bread does not break into smaller pieces. Set aside.  
3. Cook sausage in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove sausage with slotted spoon and transfer to paper towel–lined plate. Add half of onions and celery to fat left in skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, over medium-high heat until softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer onion mixture to bowl with sausage. Melt butter in now-empty skillet over medium-high heat. Add remaining onions and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in thyme, sage, garlic, salt, and pepper and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add vegetable mixture and sausage mixture to bowl with cornbread and stir gently to combine (try not to break bread into smaller pieces). Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate to blend flavors, at least 1 hour or up to 4 hours.  
4. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Grease 15 by 10-inch baking dish (or two 9-inch square or 11 by 7-inch baking dishes). Transfer stuffing to prepared baking dish; pour any liquid accumulated in bottom of bowl over stuffing and, if necessary, gently press stuffing with rubber spatula to fit into baking dish. Bake until golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.  
SPICY CORNBREAD STUFFING WITH RED PEPPER, CHIPOTLE CHILES, AND ANDOUILLE SAUSAGE  
Andouille is a spicy smoked Cajun sausage. If you cannot find any, chorizo can be substituted.  
Omit sausage and increase butter to 4 tablespoons. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 red bell peppers, stemmed, seeded, and cut into 1⁄4-inch pieces, along with one-third of onions and celery and cook until softened, about 5 minutes; transfer to bowl. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in now-empty skillet over medium-high heat. Add remaining onions and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in 4 tablespoons minced chipotle chile in adobo sauce along with thyme, sage, and garlic. Add bell pepper mixture, along with softened onion mixture and 1-1⁄2 pounds andouille sausage, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces, to bowl with cornbread.

ROAST STUFFED CORNISH GAME HENS  
#quantity  
SERVES 6  
#ingredients  
If your game hens are frozen, be sure to thaw them in the refrigerator for 24 to 36 hours before brining. Pouring a little broth into the baking sheet at the 25-minute mark, once the hens have been turned, both prevents them from smoking during cooking and makes instant jus, eliminating the need to deglaze the pan.  
Salt and pepper  
6 (1-1⁄4- to 1-1⁄2-pound) Cornish game hens, trimmed, giblets removed and discarded  
6 tablespoons balsamic vinegar  
3 tablespoons olive oil  
1 recipe prepared stuffing (recipes follow)  
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth  
1⁄4 cup dry vermouth or dry white wine  
#instructions  
1. Dissolve 1⁄2 cup salt in 4 quarts cold water in large container. Submerge hens in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour.  
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Set wire rack in aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet. Remove hens from brine and pat dry with paper towels. Season with pepper and tuck wings behind back.  
3. Whisk vinegar and oil together in small bowl and set aside. Microwave stuffing in covered bowl until very hot, about 2 minutes. Spoon 1⁄2 cup of hot stuffing into cavity of each hen, then tie each hen’s legs together with kitchen twine. Arrange hens, breast side down and with wings facing out, on prepared wire rack.  
4. Roast hens until backs are golden brown, about 25 minutes. Remove pan from oven and brush each hen with vinegar glaze. Rotate hens breast side up and with wings facing out, and brush with glaze. Add 1⁄2 cup broth to pan and continue to roast until stuffed cavity registers 150 degrees, 15 to 20 minutes longer.  
5. Remove baking sheet from oven and increase oven temperature to 450 degrees. Brush each hen with glaze, add remaining 1⁄2 cup broth to baking sheet, and continue to roast until hens are spotty brown and cavity registers 160 degrees, 5 to 10 minutes longer. Remove hens from oven, transfer to carving board, and let rest for 10 minutes. Remove twine used to truss hens.  
6. Meanwhile, pour cooking juices from pan into small saucepan and let settle for 5 minutes. Remove any fat from surface with large spoon. Add vermouth, bring to simmer, and cook until sauce thickens slightly and flavors meld, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hens, passing sauce separately.

In this variation, we skip the stuffing. Butterflying a Cornish game hen is similar to BUTTERFLYING A CHICKEN OR TURKEY. Use kitchen shears to cut out and remove the backbone, then make a 1⁄4-inch cut in the breastbone to separate the breast halves and lightly press down to flatten the bird. Finally, with the skin facing up, fold the wingtips behind the bird to secure them.  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper  
1⁄2 teaspoon dried thyme, basil, or tarragon  
4 (1-1⁄4- to 1-1⁄2-pound) Cornish game hens, trimmed, giblets removed and discarded  
2 teaspoons butter, softened

1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Set wire rack in aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet. Combine salt, pepper, and thyme in bowl.  
2. Butterfly hens, flatten breastbone, and tuck wings underneath. Pat hens dry with paper towels, then use your fingers to gently loosen skin covering breast and thighs. Rub one-quarter of salt mixture under skin of each hen. Using metal skewer, poke 4 or 5 holes in skin of each hen, then rub skin with 1⁄2 teaspoon butter. Place hens skin side up on prepared rack.  
3. Roast hens until lightly browned and thighs register 160 degrees, 20 to 25 minutes.  
4. Remove baking sheet from oven and heat broiler. Broil hens until golden brown, breasts register 160 degrees and thighs register 175 degrees, about 5 minutes. Transfer hens to carving board and let rest for 10 minutes. Drizzle any accumulated pan juices over each hen and serve.

CRISP ROAST DUCK WITH PORT WINE GLAZE  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
Port comes in many styles, but we prefer to use an inexpensive Tawny port here. For duck with very moist, tender meat and slightly crisp skin once roasted, steam the duck for about 40 minutes in step 2. Steam 10 minutes longer for somewhat denser meat and very crisp skin after roasting.  
1-1⁄4 cups port  
2 garlic cloves, sliced thin  
4 sprigs fresh thyme  
1 (4-1⁄2- to 5-pound) whole duck, trimmed, neck and giblets discarded  
Salt and pepper  
#instructions  
1. Bring port, garlic, and thyme to simmer in small saucepan and cook until thickened and measures 1⁄4 cup, 25 to 30 minutes. Discard garlic and thyme sprigs; set glaze aside until ready to use.  
2. Meanwhile, set V-rack in flameproof roasting pan and place duck breast side up on rack. Add water to just below bottom of duck, place pan over 2 burners, and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium, cover pan tightly with aluminum foil, and steam, until skin has pulled away from at least 1 leg, about 40 minutes (add more hot water to maintain water level if necessary). Transfer duck to carving board, let cool slightly, then carve into 6 pieces (2 boneless breasts, 2 legs, 2 wings). Remove rack and discard steaming liquid. Wipe out pan with paper towels.  
3. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Lightly spray now-empty pan with vegetable oil spray. Season duck pieces with salt and pepper and place skin side down in prepared pan. Roast duck, carefully removing fat if more than 2 tablespoons accumulate in pan, until skin on breast pieces is rich golden brown and crisp, about 25 minutes. Transfer breast pieces to plate and cover with foil to keep warm.  
4. Again, carefully remove excess fat from pan, turn leg and wing pieces skin side up, and continue roasting until skin is deep golden brown and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes longer. Again, carefully remove excess fat from pan. Return breast pieces to pan and brush both sides of each piece with glaze; position pieces skin side up once glazed. Roast until glaze is hot and richly colored on duck pieces, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately.  
CRISP ROAST DUCK WITH ORANGE GLAZE  
The lime juice keeps this thick, syrupy glaze from being too sweet.  
Substitute 1 cup orange juice (2 oranges), 2 tablespoons lime juice, and 2 tablespoons honey for port and omit garlic and thyme.  
PREPARING ROAST DUCK  
Trim away skin that is not directly over meat or bone. Pull back skin in neck cavity and cut away pieces of fat to expose wing joints.

PAN-SEARED INEXPENSIVE STEAKS  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
A pan sauce can be made while the steaks rest after cooking (recipes follow); if you plan to make a sauce, be sure to prepare all of the sauce ingredients before cooking the steaks. You can substitute a 2-pound whole flap meat steak for the shell sirloin steaks. To serve two instead of four, use a 10-inch skillet to cook a 1-pound steak and halve the sauce ingredients. Keep in mind that even those tasters who usually prefer rare beef preferred these steaks cooked medium-rare or medium because the texture is firmer and not quite so chewy.  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
Salt and pepper  
2 (1-pound) boneless shell sirloin steaks (top butt), 1-1⁄4 inches thick  
1 recipe PAN SAUCE (optional) (recipes follow)  
#instructions  
1. Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Meanwhile, pat steaks dry with paper towels and season both sides with salt and pepper. Place steaks in skillet; cook, without moving, until well browned, about 2 minutes. Using tongs, flip steaks; reduce heat to medium. Cook until well browned on second side and meat registers 120 to 125 degrees (for medium-rare) or 130 to 135 degrees (for medium), 5 to 6 minutes.  
2. Transfer steaks to large plate and tent loosely with aluminum foil; let rest 12 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare pan sauce, if making.  
3. Using sharp knife, slice steak about 1⁄4 inch thick against grain on bias, arrange on platter or on individual plates, and spoon sauce, if using, over steak; serve.

PAN-SEARED THICK-CUT STRIP STEAKS  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
Rib eye or filet mignon of similar thickness can be substituted for the strip steaks. If using filet mignon, buying a 2-pound center-cut tenderloin roast and portioning it into four 8-ounce steaks yourself will produce more consistent results than individual store-cut steaks. If using filet mignon, increase the oven time by about 5 minutes. When cooking lean strip steaks (without an external fat cap) or filet mignon, add an extra tablespoon of oil to the pan. If desired, serve with a pan sauce, relish, or butter (recipes follow).  
2 (1-pound) boneless strip steaks, 1-1⁄2 to 1-3⁄4 inches thick  
Salt and pepper  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
1 recipe pan sauce, relish, or butter (optional) (recipes follow)  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 275 degrees. Pat steaks dry with paper towels. Cut each steak in half vertically to create four 8-ounce steaks. Season steaks with salt and pepper; gently press sides of steaks until uniform 1-1⁄2 inches thick. Place steaks on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Cook until meat registers 90 to 95 degrees (for rare to medium-rare), 20 to 25 minutes, or 100 to 105 degrees (for medium), 25 to 30 minutes.  
2. Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over high heat until just smoking. Place steaks in skillet and sear until well browned and crusty, about 1-1⁄2 to 2 minutes, lifting once halfway through cooking to redistribute fat underneath each steak. (Reduce heat if fond begins to burn.) Using tongs, turn steaks and cook until well browned on second side, 2 to 2-1⁄2 minutes. Transfer all steaks to clean wire rack and reduce heat under pan to medium. Use tongs to stand 2 steaks on their sides. Holding steaks together, return to skillet and sear on all sides until browned, about 1-1⁄2 minutes. Repeat with remaining 2 steaks.  
3. Transfer steaks to wire rack and let rest, tented loosely with aluminum foil, for 10 minutes while preparing pan sauce, if using. Arrange steaks on individual plates and spoon sauce over steaks; serve.

1 shallot, minced  
1 cup Madeira or sherry  
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley  
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme  
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard  
1 tablespoon lemon juice  
2 anchovy fillets, rinsed and minced to paste (about 1 teaspoon)  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened

PEPPER-CRUSTED FILETS MIGNONS  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
To crush the peppercorns, spread half of them on a cutting board, place a skillet on top, and, pressing down firmly with both hands, use a rocking motion to crush the peppercorns beneath the “heel” of the skillet. Repeat with the remaining peppercorns. While heating the peppercorns in oil tempers much of their pungent heat, this recipe is still pretty spicy. If you prefer a very mild pepper flavor, drain the cooled peppercorns in a fine-mesh strainer in step 1, toss them with 5 tablespoons of fresh oil, add the salt, and proceed. Serve with either Blue Cheese–Chive Butter or Port Cherry Reduction (recipes follow).  
5 tablespoons black peppercorns, crushed  
5 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons olive oil  
1 tablespoon kosher salt  
4 (7- to 8-ounce) center-cut filets mignons, 1-1⁄2 to 2 inches thick  
#instructions  
1. Heat peppercorns and 5 tablespoons oil in small saucepan over low heat until faint bubbles appear. Continue to cook at bare simmer, swirling pan occasionally, until pepper is fragrant, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. When mixture is room temperature, add salt and stir to combine. Rub steaks with oil and pepper mixture, thoroughly coating top and bottom of each steak with peppercorns. Cover steaks with plastic wrap and press gently to make sure peppercorns adhere; let stand at room temperature for 1 hour.  
2. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position, place baking sheet on oven rack, and heat oven to 450 degrees. When oven reaches 450 degrees, heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place steaks in skillet and cook, without moving, until dark brown crust has formed, 3 to 4 minutes. Using tongs, turn steaks and cook until well browned on second side, about 3 minutes. Off heat, transfer steaks to hot baking sheet in oven. Roast until meat registers 115 to 120 degrees (for rare), 120 to 125 degrees (for medium-rare), or 130 to 135 degrees (for medium), 3 to 7 minutes.

STEAK FRITES  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
In order to have four steaks that fit in a skillet at the same time, it is necessary to buy two 1-pound steaks and cut them in half according to their thickness. If your steaks are 1-1⁄4 to 1-3⁄4 inches thick, cut them in half vertically into small, thick steaks. If your steaks are thicker than 1-3⁄4 inches, cut them in half horizontally into two thinner steaks. Make sure to dry the potatoes well before tossing them with the cornstarch. For safety, use a Dutch oven with a capacity of at least 7 quarts. Use refined peanut oil (such as Planters) to fry the potatoes, not toasted peanut oil. A 12-inch skillet is essential for cooking four steaks at once. The ingredients can be halved to serve two—keep the oil amount the same and forgo blanching and frying the potatoes in batches.  
2-1⁄2 pounds russet potatoes, scrubbed, sides squared off and cut lengthwise into 1⁄4-inch by 1⁄4-inch fries  
2 tablespoons cornstarch  
3 quarts peanut oil  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
2 (1-pound) boneless strip or rib-eye steaks, cut in half  
Kosher salt and pepper  
1 recipe HERB BUTTER  
#instructions  
1. Rinse cut potatoes in bowl under cold running water until water turns clear. Cover with cold water and refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to 12 hours.  
2. Pour off water, spread potatoes onto kitchen towels, and dry thoroughly. Transfer potatoes to bowl and toss with cornstarch until evenly coated. Transfer potatoes to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and let rest until fine white coating forms, about 20 minutes.  
3. Meanwhile, heat peanut oil in Dutch oven over medium heat to 325 degrees. Line baking sheet with brown paper bag or triple layer of paper towels.  
4. Add half of potatoes, a handful at a time, to hot oil and increase heat to high. Fry, stirring with wire skimmer or slotted spoon, until potatoes start to turn from white to blond, 4 to 5 minutes. (Oil temperature will drop about 75 degrees during this frying.) Transfer fries to prepared baking sheet. Return oil to 325 degrees and repeat with remaining potatoes. Reduce heat to medium and let fries cool while cooking steaks, at least 10 minutes. (Recipe can be prepared through step 4 up to 2 hours in advance; turn off heat under oil, turning heat back to medium when you start step 6.)  
5. Heat vegetable oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Meanwhile, pat steaks dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Lay steaks in pan, leaving 1⁄4 inch between them. Cook, without moving steaks, until well browned, about 4 minutes. Using tongs, flip steaks and continue to cook until meat registers 115 to 120 degrees (for rare) or 120 to 125 degrees (for medium-rare), 3 to 7 minutes. Transfer steaks to large plate, top with herb butter, and tent loosely with aluminum foil; let rest while finishing fries.  
6. Increase heat under Dutch oven to high and heat oil to 375 degrees. Add half of fries, a handful at a time, and fry until golden brown and puffed, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to clean brown paper bag or paper towels. Return oil to 375 degrees and repeat with remaining fries. Season fries with salt and serve with steaks.

If desired, drizzle Steak Diane with white truffle oil just before serving. Before flambéing, be sure to roll up long shirtsleeves, tie back long hair, and turn off the exhaust fan and any lit burners. If you do not wish to flambé, simmer the cognac in step 4 for 10 to 15 seconds for a slightly less sweet flavor profile.  
SAUCE BASE  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
4 teaspoons tomato paste  
1 onion, chopped  
1 carrot, chopped  
4 garlic cloves, peeled  
1⁄4 cup water  
4 teaspoons all-purpose flour  
1-1⁄2 cups dry red wine  
3-1⁄2 cups beef broth  
1-3⁄4 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
2 teaspoons black peppercorns  
8 sprigs fresh thyme  
2 bay leaves  
STEAKS  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
4 (12-ounce) boneless strip steaks, trimmed and pounded to even 1⁄2-inch thickness  
Salt and pepper  
SAUCE  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
1 small shallot, minced  
1⁄4 cup cognac  
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled  
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce  
2 tablespoons minced fresh chives  
Salt and pepper  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE SAUCE BASE: Heat oil and tomato paste in Dutch oven over medium-high heat; cook, stirring constantly, until paste begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Add onion, carrot, and garlic; cook, stirring frequently, until mixture is reddish brown, about 2 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons water and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is well browned, about 3 minutes, adding remaining water as needed to prevent scorching. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Add wine and scrape bottom and sides of pot with wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits; bring to boil, stirring occasionally (mixture will thicken slightly). Add beef and chicken broths, peppercorns, thyme, and bay leaves; bring to boil and cook, uncovered, occasionally scraping bottom and sides of pot with spatula, until reduced to 2-1⁄2 cups, 35 to 40 minutes.  
2. Strain mixture through fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; you should have about 1-1⁄4 cups.  
3. FOR THE STEAKS: Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Meanwhile, pat steaks dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Place 2 steaks in skillet and cook without moving them until well browned, about 1-1⁄2 minutes. Flip steaks and weight with heavy-bottomed pan; continue to cook until well browned on second side, about 1-1⁄2 minutes longer. Transfer steaks to large platter and tent with aluminum foil. Add 1 tablespoon oil to now-empty skillet and repeat with remaining steaks; transfer second batch of steaks to platter.  
4. FOR THE SAUCE: Off heat, add oil and shallot to now-empty skillet; using skillet’s residual heat, cook, stirring frequently, until shallots are slightly softened and browned, about 45 seconds. Add cognac; let stand until cognac warms slightly, about 10 seconds, then set skillet over high heat. Wave lit match over pan until cognac ignites, then shake pan to distribute flames. When flames subside, simmer cognac until reduced to about 1 tablespoon, about 10 seconds. Add sauce base and mustard; simmer until slightly thickened and reduced to 1 cup, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk in butter; off heat, add Worcestershire, any accumulated juices from steaks, and 1 tablespoon chives. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  
5. Transfer steaks to individual plates, spoon 2 tablespoons sauce over each steak, sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon chives, and serve, passing remaining sauce separately.

2. Meanwhile, microwave 1⁄4 cup broth and porcini mushrooms in covered bowl until steaming, about 1 minute. Let stand until softened, about 5 minutes. Drain mushrooms through fine-mesh strainer lined with coffee filter, reserve liquid, and mince mushrooms. Set mushrooms and liquid aside.  
3. Pat meat dry with paper towels and sprinkle with 1⁄2 teaspoon pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add meat and cook until well browned on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to large plate and set aside.  
4. Return skillet to medium-high heat and add remaining 1 tablespoon oil, white mushrooms, minced porcini mushrooms, and 1⁄4 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring frequently, until all liquid has evaporated and mushrooms start to brown, 7 to 9 minutes. Scrape bottom of pan with wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits. Add onion and 1⁄4 teaspoon salt; continue to cook, stirring frequently, until onion begins to brown and dark bits form on pan bottom, 6 to 8 minutes longer. Add flour, garlic, and thyme; cook, stirring constantly, until vegetables are coated with flour, about 1 minute. Stir in remaining 1-1⁄2 cups beef broth and porcini soaking liquid, scraping bottom of skillet with wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits, and bring to boil.  
5. Nestle steak pieces into mushroom and onion mixture and add any accumulated juices to skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until steak registers 130 degrees, 3 to 5 minutes, turning beef over several times. Season with salt and pepper to taste, sprinkle with parsley, and serve.

VEAL SCALOPPINI  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
Cook the veal in batches to avoid overcrowding the skillet; because the size of packaged cutlets varies, each batch may contain as few as three cutlets or as many as six. Start preparing the sauce before cooking the cutlets, then finish in the skillet used to brown the cutlets. Because meat tenderizer contains sodium, it is unnecessary to salt the cutlets.  
1-1⁄2 pounds veal cutlets, about 1⁄4 inch thick  
3⁄4 teaspoon meat tenderizer  
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper  
1⁄2 cup all-purpose flour  
3 tablespoons vegetable oil  
1 recipe sauce (recipes follow)  
#instructions  
1. If cutlets are thicker than 1⁄4 inch, place between 2 sheets of plastic wrap or waxed paper and pound to even 1⁄4-inch thickness with skillet or meat pounder. If some cutlets are thinner than 1⁄4 inch, pound to even 1⁄8-inch thickness then fold in half. Pat cutlets dry with paper towels. Sprinkle tenderizer and pepper evenly over both sides of cutlets.  
2. Place flour in rimmed baking sheet and spread to thin, even layer. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until just smoking. Dredge first batch of cutlets in flour on 1 side only, shake off excess, and place in skillet, floured side down, making sure cutlets do not overlap. Cook, without moving cutlets, until well browned, 1 to 1-1⁄2 minutes. Flip with tongs and cook until second sides are no longer pink and cutlets feel firm when pressed, about 30 seconds. Transfer cutlets to platter and tent loosely with aluminum foil. Repeat to cook remaining cutlets in 2 batches, using additional 1 tablespoon oil for each batch. (If skillet becomes too dark after cooking second batch, rinse before continuing.) Return pan to medium heat, finish pan sauce, pour over cutlets, and serve.

PERFECT PRIME RIB  
#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
With two pieces of kitchen twine running parallel to the bone, tie the roast at both ends to prevent the outer layer of meat from pulling away from the rib-eye muscle and overcooking. Serve with Individual Yorkshire Puddings, if desired.  
1 (7-pound) first-cut beef rib roast, 3 ribs, set at room temperature for 3 hours, trimmed and tied  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
Salt and pepper  
#instructions

INDIVIDUAL YORKSHIRE PUDDINGS  
#quantity  
MAKES 12  
#ingredients  
Prepare the Yorkshire pudding batter after the beef has roasted for 1 hour, then, while the roast rests, add the beef fat to the batter and get the puddings into the oven. An accurate oven temperature is key for properly risen puddings, so check your oven with an oven thermometer before making this recipe. Work quickly to fill the muffin tin with batter and do not open the oven door during baking.  
3 large eggs, room temperature  
1-1⁄2 cups whole milk, room temperature  
1-1⁄2 cups (7-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
3 tablespoons beef fat  
#instructions  
1. Whisk eggs and milk in large bowl until well combined, about 20 seconds. Whisk flour and salt in bowl and add to egg mixture; whisk quickly until flour is just incorporated and mixture is smooth, about 30 seconds. Cover batter with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour or up to 3 hours.  
2. After removing roast from oven, whisk 1 tablespoon beef fat into batter until bubbly and smooth, about 30 seconds. Transfer batter to 1-quart liquid measuring cup or other pitcher.  
3. Measure 1⁄2 teaspoon beef fat into each cup of standard muffin pan. When roast is out of oven, increase temperature to 450 degrees and place pan in oven to heat for 3 minutes (fat will smoke). Working quickly, remove pan from oven, close oven door, and divide batter evenly among 12 muffin cups, filling each about two-thirds full. Immediately return pan to oven. Bake, without opening oven door, for 20 minutes; reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees and bake until deep golden brown, about 10 minutes longer. Remove pan from oven and pierce each pudding with skewer to release steam and prevent collapse. Using hands or dinner knife, lift each pudding out of tin and serve immediately.  
CARVING PRIME RIB

STUFFING  
8 ounces cremini mushrooms, trimmed and broken into rough pieces  
1⁄2 tablespoon unsalted butter  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons olive oil  
1 onion, halved and sliced 1⁄4 inch thick  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper  
1 garlic clove, minced  
1⁄2 cup Madeira or sweet Marsala wine  
BEEF ROAST  
1 (2- to 3-pound) beef tenderloin center-cut Châteaubriand, trimmed  
Kosher salt and pepper  
1⁄2 cup baby spinach  
3 tablespoons olive oil  
HERB BUTTER  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened  
1 tablespoon whole grain mustard  
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley  
1 garlic clove, minced  
3⁄4 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE STUFFING: Process mushrooms in food processor until coarsely chopped, about 6 pulses. Heat butter and oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, salt, and pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until onion begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until all moisture has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are deeply browned and sticky, about 10 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Slowly stir in Madeira and cook, scraping bottom of skillet with wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits, until liquid has evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer mushroom mixture to plate and cool to room temperature.  
2. FOR THE ROAST: To butterfly roast, insert chef’s knife about 1 inch from bottom of roast and cut horizontally, stopping just before edge. Open meat like a book. Make another cut diagonally into thicker portion of roast. Open up this flap, smoothing out butterflied rectangle of meat. Season cut side of roast with kosher salt and pepper. Spread cooled stuffing mixture over interior of roast, leaving 1⁄2-inch border on all sides; lay spinach on top of stuffing. Roll roast lengthwise and tie with 8 pieces kitchen twine evenly spaced.  
3. Stir 1 tablespoon oil, 1-1⁄2 teaspoons kosher salt, and 1-1⁄2 teaspoons pepper together in small bowl. Rub roast with oil mixture and let stand at room temperature for 1 hour.  
4. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add beef and cook until well browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes total. Transfer beef to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and place in oven.

Add the gelatin to the horseradish paste at the last moment, or the mixture will become unspreadable. If desired, serve the roast with HORSERADISH CREAM SAUCE (you will need 2 jars of prepared horseradish for both the roast and sauce). If you choose to salt the tenderloin in advance, remove it from the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking.  
1 (2-pound) beef tenderloin center-cut Châteaubriand, trimmed  
Kosher salt and pepper  
3 tablespoons panko bread crumbs  
2 teaspoons plus 1 cup vegetable oil  
1⁄4 cup well-drained prepared horseradish  
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley  
1 small shallot, minced  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
1⁄2 teaspoon minced fresh thyme  
1 small russet potato (6 ounces), peeled and grated on large holes of box grater  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons mayonnaise  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons Dijon mustard  
1⁄2 teaspoon unflavored gelatin  
#instructions  
1. Sprinkle roast with 1 tablespoon salt, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand at room temperature for 1 hour or refrigerate for up to 24 hours. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees.  
2. Toss panko with 2 teaspoons oil, 1⁄4 teaspoon salt, and 1⁄4 teaspoon pepper in 10-inch nonstick skillet. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until deep golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet and cool to room temperature (wipe out skillet). Once cool, toss bread crumbs with 2 tablespoons horseradish, parsley, shallot, garlic, and thyme.  
3. Rinse grated potato under cold water, then squeeze dry in kitchen towel. Transfer potato and remaining 1 cup oil to 10-inch nonstick skillet. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until potato is golden brown and crisp, 6 to 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer potato to paper towel–lined plate and season with salt to taste; cool for 5 minutes. Reserve 1 tablespoon oil from skillet and discard remainder. Once potato is cool, transfer to 1-quart zipper-lock bag and crush until coarsely ground. Transfer potato to baking sheet with bread-crumb mixture and toss to combine.  
4. Pat tenderloin dry with paper towels and sprinkle evenly with 1 teaspoon pepper. Heat reserved 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Sear tenderloin until well browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and let rest for 10 minutes.  
5. Combine remaining 2 tablespoons horseradish, mayonnaise, and mustard in small bowl. Just before coating tenderloin, add gelatin and stir to combine. Spread horseradish paste on top and sides of meat, leaving bottom and ends bare. Roll coated sides of tenderloin in bread-crumb mixture, pressing gently so crumbs adhere in even layer that just covers horseradish paste; pat off any excess.  
6. Return tenderloin to wire rack. Roast until meat registers 120 to 125 degrees (for medium-rare), 25 to 30 minutes.  
7. Transfer roast to carving board and let rest for 20 minutes. Carefully cut meat into 1⁄2-inch-thick slices and serve.  
TO MAKE AHEAD: To make recipe 1 day in advance, prepare through step 3, but in step 2 do not toss bread crumbs with other ingredients until ready to sear meat.

2⁄3 cup crushed saltines (about 16) or 2⁄3 cup quick oats or 1-1⁄3 cups fresh bread crumbs  
1⁄3 cup minced fresh parsley  
8–12 slices bacon  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE GLAZE: Combine all ingredients in small saucepan; set aside.  
2. FOR THE MEATLOAF: Line 13 by 9-inch baking pan with aluminum foil; set aside. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Heat oil in 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool while preparing remaining ingredients.  
3. In large bowl, combine milk, eggs, mustard, Worcestershire, salt, pepper, thyme, and hot sauce. Add meat, saltines, parsley, and sautéed onion mixture; mix with fork until evenly blended and meat mixture does not stick to bowl. (If mixture sticks, add additional milk, 2 tablespoons at a time, until mixture no longer sticks.)  
4. Turn meat mixture onto work surface. With wet hands, pat mixture into approximately 9 by 5-inch loaf shape. Place in prepared baking pan. Brush with half of glaze, then arrange bacon slices, crosswise, over loaf, overlapping slightly and tucking only bacon tip ends under loaf.  
5. Bake loaf until bacon is crisp and loaf registers 160 degrees, about 1 hour. Cool at least 20 minutes. Simmer remaining glaze over medium heat until thickened slightly. Slice meatloaf and serve with extra glaze.  
LOAF-PAN MEATLOAF  
Omit bacon. Turn meat mixture into meatloaf pan with perforated bottom, fitted with drip pan. Use fork to pull mixture from pan sides to prevent glaze from dripping into oven. Brush with one-quarter of glaze. Bake until glaze is set, about 45 minutes. Top with another one-quarter of glaze; continue to bake until second coat has set and loaf registers 160 degrees, about 15 minutes longer. Cool at least 20 minutes. Simmer remaining glaze over medium heat until thickened slightly. Slice meatloaf and serve with extra glaze.

#ingredients  
If you can’t find chuck and/or sirloin, substitute any 85 percent lean ground beef. Handle the meat gently; it should be thoroughly combined but not pastelike. To avoid using the broiler, glaze the loaf in a 500-degree oven; increase cooking time for each interval by 2 to 3 minutes.  
MEATLOAF  
3 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded (3⁄4 cup)  
1 tablespoon unsalted butter  
1 onion, chopped fine  
1 celery rib, chopped fine  
2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme  
1 garlic clove, minced  
1 teaspoon paprika  
1⁄4 cup tomato juice  
1⁄2 cup low-sodium chicken broth  
2 large eggs  
1⁄2 teaspoon unflavored gelatin  
2⁄3 cup crushed saltines (about 16)  
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley  
1 tablespoon soy sauce  
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper  
1 pound ground sirloin  
1 pound ground beef chuck  
GLAZE  
1⁄2 cup ketchup  
1 teaspoon hot sauce  
1⁄2 teaspoon ground coriander  
1⁄4 cup cider vinegar  
3 tablespoons packed light brown sugar  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE MEATLOAF: Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 375 degrees. Spread cheese on plate and place in freezer until ready to use. Fold piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil to form 10 by 6-inch rectangle. Center foil on wire rack and place rack in rimmed baking sheet. Poke holes in foil with skewer about half inch apart. Spray foil with vegetable oil spray and set aside.  
2. Melt butter in 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat; add onion and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Add thyme, garlic, and paprika and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low and add tomato juice. Cook, scraping bottom of skillet with wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits, until thickened, about 1 minute. Transfer mixture to bowl and set aside to cool.  
3. Whisk broth and eggs in large bowl until combined. Sprinkle gelatin over liquid and let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in saltines, parsley, soy sauce, mustard, salt, pepper, and onion mixture. Crumble frozen cheese into coarse powder and sprinkle over mixture. Add ground beef; mix gently with hands until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute. Transfer meat to aluminum foil rectangle and shape into 10 by 6-inch oval about 2 inches high. Smooth top and edges of meatloaf with moistened spatula. Bake until meatloaf registers 135 to 140 degrees, 55 to 65 minutes. Remove meatloaf from oven and turn on broiler.  
4. FOR THE GLAZE: While meatloaf cooks, combine glaze ingredients in small saucepan; bring to simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring, until thick and syrupy, about 5 minutes. Spread half of glaze evenly over cooked meatloaf with rubber spatula; place under broiler and cook until glaze bubbles and begins to brown at edges, about 5 minutes. Remove meatloaf from oven and spread evenly with remaining glaze; place back under broiler and cook until glaze is again bubbling and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes more. Cool meatloaf about 20 minutes before slicing.

Sirloin steak tips are also sold as flap meat. Flank steak can be used in its place. This recipe yields juicy medium to medium-well burgers. It’s important to use very soft buns. If doubling the recipe, process the meat in three batches in step 2. Because the cooked burgers do not hold well, fry four burgers and serve them immediately before frying more, or cook them in two pans. Extra patties can be frozen for up to 2 weeks. Stack the patties, separated by parchment, and wrap them in three layers of plastic wrap. Thaw burgers in a single layer on a baking sheet at room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking.  
10 ounces sirloin steak tips, trimmed and cut into 1-inch chunks  
6 ounces boneless beef short ribs, trimmed and cut into 1-inch chunks

#instructions  
1. Place beef chunks on baking sheet in single layer, leaving 1⁄2 inch of space around each chunk. Freeze meat until very firm and starting to harden around edges but still pliable, 15 to 25 minutes.  
2. Pulse half of meat in food processor until coarsely ground, 10 to 15 pulses, stopping and redistributing meat around bowl as necessary to ensure beef is evenly ground. Transfer meat to baking sheet, overturning workbowl and without directly touching meat. Repeat grinding with remaining meat. Spread meat over sheet and inspect carefully, discarding any long strands of gristle or large chunks of hard meat or fat.  
3. Gently separate ground meat into 4 equal mounds. Without picking meat up, use fingers to gently shape each mound into loose patty 1⁄2 inch thick and 4 inches in diameter, leaving edges and surface ragged. Season top of each patty with salt and pepper. Using spatula, flip patties and season other side. Refrigerate while toasting buns.  
4. Melt 1⁄2 tablespoon butter in 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add bun tops, cut side down, and toast until light golden brown, about 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining butter and bun bottoms. Set buns aside and wipe out skillet with paper towels.  
5. Return skillet to high heat; add oil and heat until just smoking. Using spatula, transfer burgers to skillet and cook without moving for 3 minutes. Using spatula, flip burgers over and cook for 1 minute. Top each patty with slice of cheese and continue to cook until cheese is melted, about 1 minute longer.  
6. Transfer patties to bun bottoms and top with onion. Spread about 1 tablespoon of burger sauce on each bun top. Cover burgers and serve immediately.

1⁄2 cup packed fresh cilantro leaves  
3 garlic cloves, chopped coarse  
3 scallions, chopped coarse  
1 jalapeño chile, stemmed, seeds reserved, and chopped coarse  
1⁄2 teaspoon ground cumin  
1⁄4 cup vegetable oil  
1 tablespoon lime juice

1⁄2 teaspoon pepper  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
TACOS  
12 (6-inch) corn tortillas, warmed  
Fresh cilantro  
Minced white or red onion

#instructions  
1. FOR THE HERB PASTE: Pulse cilantro, garlic, scallions, jalapeño, and cumin in food processor until finely chopped, 10 to 12 pulses, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary. Add oil and process until mixture is smooth and resembles pesto, about 15 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary. Transfer 2 tablespoons herb paste to medium bowl; whisk in lime juice and set aside.  
2. FOR THE STEAK: Using dinner fork, poke each piece of steak 10 to 12 times on each side. Place in large baking dish; rub all sides of steak pieces evenly with salt and then coat with remaining herb paste. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.  
3. Scrape herb paste off steak and sprinkle all sides of pieces evenly with sugar and pepper. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place steak in skillet and cook until well browned, about 3 minutes. Flip steak and sear until second side is well browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Using tongs, stand each piece on a cut side and cook, turning as necessary, until all cut sides are well browned and meat registers 125 to 130 degrees, 2 to 7 minutes. Transfer steak to carving board and let rest for 5 minutes.

To make this dish spicier, add the reserved chile seeds with the vinegar.  
1 red onion, sliced thin (1-1⁄2 cups)  
1 cup red wine vinegar  
1⁄3 cup sugar  
2 jalapeño chiles, stemmed, seeds reserved, and cut into thin rings  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
Place onion in medium heatproof bowl. Bring vinegar, sugar, jalapeños, and salt to simmer in small saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar dissolves. Pour vinegar mixture over onion, cover loosely, and cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Once cool, drain and discard liquid. (Pickled onions can be refrigerated in airtight container for up to 1 week.)  
SLICING FLANK STEAK  
With its pronounced longitudinal grain, flank steak can be tough and chewy if sliced the wrong way. Make sure to cut the meat into thin slices on the bias, across the grain. This cuts through the connective tissue in the meat and make it more tender.

The traditional accompaniments for Swedish meatballs are lingonberry preserves and Swedish Pickled Cucumbers. If you can’t find lingonberry preserves, cranberry preserves may be used. For a slightly less sweet dish, omit the brown sugar in the meatballs and reduce the brown sugar in the sauce to 2 teaspoons. A 12-inch slope-sided skillet can be used in place of the sauté pan—use 1-1⁄2 cups of oil to fry instead of 1-1⁄4 cups. Serve the meatballs with mashed potatoes, boiled red potatoes, or egg noodles.  
MEATBALLS  
1 large egg  
1⁄4 cup heavy cream  
1 slice hearty white sandwich bread, crusts removed and bread torn into 1-inch pieces  
8 ounces ground pork  
1⁄4 cup grated onion  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons salt  
1 teaspoon packed brown sugar  
1 teaspoon baking powder  
1⁄8 teaspoon ground nutmeg  
1⁄8 teaspoon ground allspice  
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper  
8 ounces 85 percent lean ground beef  
1-1⁄4 cups vegetable oil  
SAUCE  
1 tablespoon unsalted butter  
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour  
1-1⁄2 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
1 tablespoon packed brown sugar  
1⁄2 cup heavy cream  
2 teaspoons lemon juice  
Salt and pepper  
#instructions  
1. FOR MEATBALLS: Whisk egg and cream together in bowl. Stir in bread and set aside. Meanwhile, using stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat pork, onion, salt, sugar, baking powder, nutmeg, allspice, and pepper on high speed until smooth and pale, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl as necessary. Using fork, mash bread mixture until no large dry bread chunks remain; add mixture to mixer bowl and beat on high speed until smooth and homogeneous, about 1 minute, scraping down bowl as necessary. Add beef and mix on medium-low speed until just incorporated, about 30 seconds, scraping down bowl as necessary. Using moistened hands, form generous tablespoon of meat mixture into 1-inch round meatball; repeat with remaining mixture to form 25 to 30 meatballs.  
2. Heat oil in 10-inch straight-sided sauté pan over medium-high heat until edge of meatball dipped in oil sizzles (oil should register 350 degrees on instant-read thermometer), 3 to 5 minutes. Add meatballs in single layer and fry, flipping once halfway through cooking, until lightly browned all over and cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. (Adjust heat as needed to keep oil sizzling but not smoking.) Using slotted spoon, transfer browned meatballs to paper towel–lined plate.  
3. FOR SAUCE: Pour off and discard oil in pan, leaving any browned bits behind. Return pan to medium-high heat and melt butter. Add flour and cook, whisking constantly, until flour is light brown, about 30 seconds. Slowly whisk in broth, scraping bottom of pan with wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits. Add sugar and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium and cook until sauce is reduced to about 1 cup, about 5 minutes. Stir in cream and return to simmer.  
4. Add meatballs to sauce and simmer, turning occasionally, until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice, season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve.  
TO MAKE AHEAD: Meatballs can be fried and then frozen for up to 2 weeks. To continue with recipe, thaw meatballs in refrigerator overnight and proceed from step 3, using clean pan.

EASY PORK CHOPS  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  

4 (6- to 8-ounce) bone-in pork rib or center-cut chops, 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 inch thick, trimmed  
1 teaspoon vegetable oil  
Salt and pepper  
1⁄2 teaspoon sugar  
#instructions  
1. Pat chops dry with paper towels. Cut 2 slits, about 2 inches apart, through outer layer of fat and silver skin on each chop. If using electric stove, turn burner to medium heat. Rub both sides of each chop with 1⁄8 teaspoon oil and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle 1 side of each chop evenly with 1⁄8 teaspoon sugar, avoiding bone.  
2. Place chops, sugared side down, in 12-inch nonstick skillet. Using hands, press meat of each chop into pan. Set skillet over medium heat; cook until lightly browned, 4 to 9 minutes (chops should be sizzling after 2 minutes). Using tongs, flip chops, positioning them in same manner. Cover skillet, reduce heat to low, and cook until each chop registers 145 degrees, 3 to 6 minutes (begin checking temperature after 2 minutes); chops will barely brown on second side. Transfer chops to platter, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 minutes; do not discard liquid in skillet.  
3. Add any accumulated meat juices to skillet. Set skillet over high heat and simmer vigorously until reduced to about 3 tablespoons, 30 to 90 seconds; season with salt and pepper to taste. Off heat, return pork chops to skillet, turning chops to coat with reduced juices. Serve chops, browned side up, pouring any remaining juices over.  
EASY PORK CHOPS WITH MUSTARD-SAGE SAUCE  
After transferring chops to platter, pour liquid in skillet into bowl. While chops are resting, add 1 teaspoon vegetable oil and 1 minced garlic clove to now-empty skillet; set skillet over medium heat and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add 1⁄4 cup low-sodium chicken broth; increase heat to high and simmer until reduced to about 2 tablespoons, about 3 minutes. Add pork chop juices to skillet. Off heat, whisk in 3 tablespoons unsalted butter and 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard until combined. Stir in 1 tablespoon minced fresh sage and season with salt and pepper to taste; spoon sauce over chops and serve.  
EASY PORK CHOPS WITH BRANDY AND PRUNES  
Cover 1⁄3 cup chopped pitted prunes with 1⁄4 cup brandy and let stand. After transferring chops to platter, pour liquid in skillet into bowl. While chops are resting, add 1 teaspoon vegetable oil and 1 minced shallot to now-empty skillet; set skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until shallot is softened, about 2 minutes. Off heat, add brandy and prunes; set skillet over medium-high heat and cook until brandy is reduced to about 2 tablespoons, about 3 minutes. Add pork chop juices to skillet. Off heat, whisk in 2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme and 3 tablespoons butter until combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste; spoon sauce over chops and serve.  
NO-CURL PORK CHOPS  
To prevent pork chops from curling in a hot pan, cut two slits, about 2 inches apart, into the fat and silver skin of each chop (this method works for both bone-in and boneless chops). A flat chop will develop a better crust, cook evenly, and taste better.

Buy chops of similar thickness so that they cook at the same rate. If the pork is enhanced (injected with a salt solution), do not salt in step 1, but season with salt in step 2. Serve the chops with a pan sauce (recipes follow) or with applesauce.  
4 (12-ounce) bone-in pork rib chops, 1-1⁄2 inches thick, trimmed  
Kosher salt and pepper  
1–2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
1 recipe pan sauce (recipes follow)  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 275 degrees. Pat chops dry with paper towels. Cut 2 slits, about 2 inches apart, through outer layer of fat and silver skin on each chop. Sprinkle each chop with 1 teaspoon salt. Place chops on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and let stand at room temperature for 45 minutes.  
2. Season chops with pepper; transfer baking sheet to oven. Cook until chops register 120 to 125 degrees, 30 to 45 minutes.  
3. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over high heat until just smoking. Place 2 chops in skillet and sear until well browned and crusty, 1-1⁄2 to 3 minutes, lifting once halfway through to redistribute fat underneath each chop. (Reduce heat if browned bits in pan start to burn.) Using tongs, turn chops and cook until well browned on second side, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer chops to plate and repeat with remaining 2 chops, adding extra 1 tablespoon oil if pan is dry.  
4. Reduce heat to medium. Use tongs to stand 2 pork chops on their sides. Holding chops together with tongs, return to skillet and sear sides of chops (with exception of bone side) until browned and chops register 145 degrees, about 1-1⁄2 minutes. Repeat with remaining 2 chops. Let chops rest, tented loosely with aluminum foil, for 10 minutes while preparing sauce.

PORK CHOPS WITH VINEGAR AND SWEET PEPPERS  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
For this recipe, we prefer rib chops, but center-cut chops, which contain a portion of tenderloin, can be used instead. If the pork is enhanced (injected with a salt solution), do not brine in step 1, and season with salt in step 1. To keep the chops from overcooking and becoming tough and dry, they are removed from the oven when they are just shy of fully cooked; as they sit in the hot skillet, they continue to cook with residual heat. The vinegar stirred into the sauce at the end adds a bright, fresh flavor. However, taste the sauce before you add the vinegar—you may prefer to omit it.  
Salt  
3 tablespoons sugar  
4 (8- to 10-ounce) bone-in pork rib chops, 3⁄4 to 1 inch thick, trimmed  
Pepper  
2 tablespoons olive oil  
1 large onion, chopped fine  
1 large red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and cut into 1⁄4-inch-wide strips  
1 large yellow bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and cut into 1⁄4-inch-wide strips  
2 anchovy fillets, rinsed and minced  
1 sprig fresh rosemary  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
3⁄4 cup water  
1⁄2 cup plus 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley  
#instructions  
1. Dissolve 3 tablespoons salt and sugar in 1-1⁄2 quarts cold water in large container. Submerge chops in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Remove chops from brine; thoroughly pat dry with paper towels, season with 3⁄4 teaspoon pepper, and set aside.  
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 400 degrees. Heat oil in 12-inch ovensafe skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking; swirl skillet to coat with oil. Place chops in skillet; cook until well browned, 3 to 4 minutes, using spoon or spatula to press down on center of chops to aid in browning. Using tongs, flip chops and brown lightly on second side, about 1 minute. Transfer chops to large plate; set aside.  
3. Set skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until just beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Add peppers, anchovies, and rosemary; cook, stirring frequently, until peppers just begin to soften, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add water and 1⁄2 cup vinegar and bring to boil, scraping bottom of pan with wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits. Reduce heat to medium; simmer until liquid is reduced to about 1⁄3 cup, 6 to 8 minutes. Off heat, discard rosemary.  
4. Return pork chops, browned side up, to skillet; nestle chops in peppers, but do not cover chops with peppers. Add any accumulated juices to skillet; set skillet in oven and cook until chops registers 145 degrees, 8 to 12 minutes (begin checking temperature after 6 minutes). Using potholders, carefully remove skillet from oven (handle will be very hot) and cover skillet with lid or aluminum foil; let rest for 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer chops to platter or individual plates. Swirl butter into sauce and peppers in skillet; stir in 2 tablespoons vinegar (if using) and parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then pour or spoon sauce and peppers over chops. Serve.

Serve these smothered chops with a starch to soak up the rich gravy. Simple egg noodles are our favorite, but rice or mashed potatoes also taste great.  
3 slices bacon, cut into 1⁄4-inch pieces  
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour  
1-3⁄4 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus extra as needed  
4 (6- to 8-ounce) bone-in pork rib chops, 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 inch thick, trimmed  
Salt and pepper  
2 onions, halved and sliced thin  
2 tablespoons water  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme  
2 bay leaves  
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley  
#instructions  
1. Fry bacon in small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towel–lined plate, leaving fat in saucepan (you should have 2 tablespoons bacon fat; if not, supplement with vegetable oil). Reduce heat to medium-low and gradually whisk flour into fat until smooth. Cook, whisking frequently, until mixture is light brown, about the color of peanut butter, about 5 minutes. Whisk in chicken broth in slow, steady stream; increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil, stirring occasionally; cover and set aside off heat.  
2. Pat pork chops dry with paper towels and season with 1⁄2 teaspoon pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over high heat until just smoking. Brown chops in single layer until deep golden brown on first side, about 3 minutes. Flip chops and cook until browned on second side, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer chops to large plate and set aside.  
3. Reduce heat to medium and add 1 tablespoon oil, onions, 1⁄4 teaspoon salt, and water to now-empty skillet. Scrape bottom of skillet with wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are softened and browned around the edges, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and thyme and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Return chops to skillet in single layer, covering chops with onions. Pour in warm sauce and any accumulated juices from pork; add bay leaves. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until pork is tender and paring knife inserted in chops meets very little resistance, about 30 minutes.  
4. Transfer chops to warmed serving platter and tent loosely with aluminum foil. Increase heat to medium-high and simmer sauce rapidly, stirring frequently, until thickened to gravylike consistency, about 5 minutes. Discard bay leaves, stir in parsley, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon sauce over chops, sprinkle with reserved bacon, and serve.

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Dissolve 3 tablespoons salt in 1-1⁄2 quarts cold water in large container. Submerge chops in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Remove chops from brine and thoroughly pat dry with paper towels.  
2. Meanwhile, pulse bread in food processor until coarsely ground, about 8 pulses (you should have about 3-1⁄2 cups crumbs). Transfer crumbs to rimmed baking sheet and add oil, shallot, garlic, 1⁄4 teaspoon salt, and 1⁄4 teaspoon pepper. Toss until crumbs are evenly coated with oil. Bake until deep golden brown and dry, about 15 minutes, stirring twice during baking time. (Do not turn off oven.) Cool to room temperature. Add crumbs to Parmesan, parsley, and thyme. (Bread-crumb mixture can be prepared up to 3 days in advance.)  
3. Place 1⁄4 cup flour in pie plate. In second pie plate, whisk egg whites and mustard until combined; add remaining 6 tablespoons flour and whisk until almost smooth, with pea-size lumps remaining.  
4. Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees. Spray wire rack with vegetable oil spray and set in rimmed baking sheet. Season chops with pepper. Dredge 1 pork chop in flour; shake off excess. Using tongs, coat with egg mixture; let excess drip off. Coat all sides of chop with bread-crumb mixture, pressing gently so that thick layer of crumbs adheres to chop. Transfer breaded chop to wire rack. Repeat with remaining 3 chops.  
5. Bake until chops register 145 degrees, 17 to 25 minutes. Let rest on rack 5 minutes before serving with lemon wedges.  
TO MAKE AHEAD: Breaded chops can be frozen for up to 1 week. Do not thaw before baking; simply increase cooking time in step 5 to 35 to 40 minutes.  
CRUNCHY BAKED PORK CHOPS WITH PROSCIUTTO AND ASIAGO CHEESE  
Omit salt added to bread-crumb mixture in step 2. Before breading, place 1⁄8-inch-thick slice Asiago cheese (about 1⁄2 ounce) on top of each chop. Wrap each chop with thin slice prosciutto, pressing on prosciutto so that cheese and meat adhere to one another. Proceed with recipe from step 4, being careful when handling chops so that cheese and meat do not come apart during breading.

SAUTÉED PORK CUTLETS WITH MUSTARD-CIDER SAUCE  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
If the pork is enhanced (injected with a salt solution), do not brine in step 1, and season with salt in step 3. Look for ribs that are about 3 to 5 inches long. Cut ribs over 5 inches in half crosswise before slicing them lengthwise to make pounding more manageable.  
PORK  
1-1⁄2 pounds boneless country-style pork spare ribs, trimmed  
3 tablespoons salt  
3 tablespoons sugar  
Pepper  
1 tablespoon olive oil  
1⁄2 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into 2 pieces  
MUSTARD-CIDER SAUCE  
1 tablespoon unsalted butter  
1 small shallot, minced  
1 teaspoon all-purpose flour  
1 teaspoon dry mustard  
1⁄2 cup beef broth or low-sodium chicken broth  
1⁄4 cup apple cider  
1⁄2 teaspoon minced fresh sage  
2 teaspoons whole grain mustard  
Salt and pepper  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE PORK: Cut each rib lengthwise to create 2 or 3 cutlets about 3⁄8 inch wide. Place cutlets between 2 layers of plastic wrap and gently pound to 1⁄4-inch thickness. Dissolve salt and sugar in 1-1⁄2 quarts cold water in large container. Submerge pork in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour.  
2. FOR THE SAUCE: While pork brines, melt 1⁄2 tablespoon butter in small saucepan over medium heat; add shallot and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 1-1⁄2 minutes. Add flour and dry mustard; cook, stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Slowly add broth, whisking constantly to avoid forming lumps. Add cider and sage and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer 5 minutes. Off heat, cover and set aside. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees.  
3. TO COOK PORK: Remove pork from brine, thoroughly pat dry with paper towels, and season with pepper. Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add 1 piece butter, allow to melt, and quickly add half of pork cutlets. Cook cutlets until browned, about 1 to 2 minutes. Using tongs, flip cutlets and continue to cook until browned on second side, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Transfer cutlets to large plate and transfer plate to warm oven. Repeat with remaining cutlets and remaining butter.  
4. After second batch of cutlets is cooked, reduce skillet heat to medium, add reserved sauce, and bring to simmer. Cook, scraping bottom of skillet with wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits, until slightly thickened and reduced to about 1⁄2 cup, about 2 minutes. Stir in any pork juices; return to simmer and cook 30 seconds. Off heat, whisk in whole grain mustard and remaining 1⁄2 tablespoon butter; season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon sauce over pork and serve.  
SAUTÉED PORK CUTLETS WITH LEMON-CAPER SAUCE  
Substitute white wine for cider and 2 teaspoons lemon juice for sage in step 2. Substitute 1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley leaves, 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest, and 2 tablespoons rinsed capers for mustard in step 4.  
CUTTING PORK TENDERLOIN FOR CUTLETS  
Cut tenderloin in half at about 20-degree angle. Using same angle, cut each half in half again, cutting tapered tail pieces slightly thicker than middle medallions.

PORK SCHNITZEL  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
The 2 cups of oil called for in this recipe may seem like a lot, but this amount is necessary to achieve a wrinkled texture on the finished cutlets. When properly cooked, the cutlets absorb very little oil. To ensure ample cooking space, a large Dutch oven is essential. In lieu of an instant-read thermometer to gauge the oil’s temperature, place a fresh (not dry) bread cube in the oil and start heating; when the bread is deep golden brown, the oil is ready.  
PORK  
7 slices hearty white sandwich bread, crusts removed, bread cut into 3⁄4-inch cubes  
1⁄2 cup all-purpose flour  
2 large eggs  
1 tablespoon plus 2 cups vegetable oil  
1 (1-1⁄4-pound) pork tenderloin, trimmed and cut on angle into 4 equal pieces  
Salt and pepper  
GARNISHES  
Lemon wedges  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley  
2 tablespoons capers, rinsed  
1 large hard-cooked egg, yolk and white separated and passed separately through fine-mesh strainer (optional)  
#instructions  
1. Place bread cubes on large plate. Microwave on high power for 4 minutes, stirring well halfway through cooking. Microwave on medium power until bread is dry and few pieces start to lightly brown, 3 to 5 minutes longer, stirring every minute. Process dry bread in food processor to very fine crumbs, about 45 seconds. Transfer bread crumbs to shallow dish (you should have about 1-1⁄4 cups crumbs). Spread flour in second shallow dish. Beat eggs with 1 tablespoon oil in third shallow dish.  
2. Working with 1 piece at a time, place pork, with 1 cut side down, between 2 sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap and pound to even thickness between 1⁄8 and 1⁄4 inch. Pat cutlets dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Working with 1 cutlet at a time, dredge cutlets thoroughly in flour, shaking off excess, then coat with egg mixture, allowing excess to drip back into dish to ensure very thin coating, and coat evenly with bread crumbs, pressing on crumbs to adhere. Place breaded cutlets in single layer on wire rack set over baking sheet; let coating dry for 5 minutes.  
3. Heat remaining 2 cups oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until it registers 375 degrees. Lay 2 cutlets, without overlapping, in pan and cook, shaking pan continuously and gently, until cutlets are wrinkled and light golden brown on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer cutlets to paper towel–lined plate and flip cutlets several times to blot excess oil. Repeat with remaining cutlets. Serve with garnishes.

CRISP BREADED PORK CUTLETS  
#quantity  
SERVES 3  
#ingredients  
If you have two skillets, you can use both at once to cut the time it takes to fry. Our favorite accompaniments for breaded pork cutlets are applesauce, mashed potatoes, or coleslaw.  
6 slices hearty white sandwich bread, crusts removed, bread torn into rough 1-1⁄2-inch pieces  
1⁄2 cup all-purpose flour  
2 large eggs  
1 tablespoon plus 1 cup vegetable oil  
1 (1-pound) pork tenderloin, trimmed and cut on angle into 6 equal pieces  
Salt and pepper  
#instructions  
1. Process bread in food processor until evenly fine-textured, 10 to 15 seconds (you should have about 3 cups fresh bread crumbs); transfer crumbs to pie plate or shallow baking dish.  
2. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position, set large ovensafe plate on rack, and heat oven to 200 degrees. Spread flour in second pie plate. Beat eggs with 1 tablespoon oil in third pie plate.  
3. Working with 1 piece at a time, place pork, with 1 cut side down, between 2 sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap and pound to even 1⁄2-inch thickness. Pat cutlets dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Working with 1 cutlet at a time, dredge cutlets thoroughly in flour, shaking off excess. Using tongs, dip both sides of cutlets in egg mixture, allowing excess to drip back into pie plate to ensure very thin coating. Dip both sides of cutlets in bread crumbs, pressing crumbs with fingers to form even, cohesive coat. Place breaded cutlets in single layer on wire rack set over baking sheet and allow coating to dry about 5 minutes.  
4. Meanwhile, heat 1⁄2 cup oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering, about 2-1⁄2 minutes. Lay 3 cutlets in skillet; fry until deep golden brown and crisp on first side, gently pressing down on cutlets with wide metal spatula to help ensure even browning and checking browning partway through, about 2-1⁄2 minutes (smaller cutlets from tail end of tenderloin may cook faster). Using tongs, flip cutlets, reduce heat to medium, and continue to cook until meat feels firm when pressed gently and second side is deep golden brown and crisp, again checking browning partway through, about 2-1⁄2 minutes longer. Line warmed plate with double layer of paper towels and set cutlets on top; return plate to oven.  
5. Discard oil in skillet and wipe skillet clean. Repeat step 4 using remaining 1⁄2 cup oil and preheating oil just 2 minutes to cook remaining 3 cutlets.

MAPLE-GLAZED PORK TENDERLOINS  
#quantity  
SERVES 6  
#ingredients  
If the pork is enhanced (injected with a salt solution), do not add salt to the cornstarch mixture in step 1. If your tenderloins are smaller than 1-1⁄4 pounds, reduce the cooking time in step 3. If the tenderloins don’t fit in the skillet initially, let their ends curve toward each other; the meat will eventually shrink as it cooks. Make sure to cook the tenderloins until they turn deep golden brown in step 2 or they will appear pale after glazing. We prefer grade B maple syrup in this recipe. (Don’t be tempted to substitute imitation maple syrup—it will be too sweet.) Be sure to pat off the cornstarch mixture thoroughly in step 1, as any excess will leave gummy spots on the tenderloins.  
3⁄4 cup maple syrup  
1⁄4 cup light or mild molasses  
2 tablespoons bourbon or brandy  
1⁄8 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
Pinch ground cloves  
Pinch cayenne pepper  
1⁄4 cup cornstarch  
2 tablespoons sugar  
1 tablespoon salt  
2 teaspoons pepper  
2 (1-1⁄4- to 1-1⁄2-pound) pork tenderloins, trimmed  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
1 tablespoon whole grain mustard  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Stir 1⁄2 cup maple syrup, molasses, bourbon, cinnamon, cloves, and cayenne together in 2-cup liquid measure; set aside. Whisk cornstarch, sugar, salt, and pepper in small bowl until combined. Transfer cornstarch mixture to rimmed baking sheet. Pat tenderloins dry with paper towels, then roll in cornstarch mixture until evenly coated on all sides. Thoroughly pat off excess cornstarch mixture.  
2. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Reduce heat to medium and place both tenderloins in skillet, leaving at least 1 inch in between. Cook until well browned on all sides, 8 to 12 minutes. Transfer tenderloins to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet.  
3. Pour off excess fat from skillet and return to medium heat. Add syrup mixture to skillet, scraping bottom of skillet with wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits, and cook until reduced to 1⁄2 cup, about 2 minutes. Transfer 2 tablespoons glaze to small bowl and set aside. Using remaining glaze, brush each tenderloin with approximately 1 tablespoon glaze. Roast until thickest part of tenderloins registers 130 degrees, 12 to 20 minutes. Brush each tenderloin with 1 tablespoon glaze and continue to roast until thickest part of tenderloins registers 145 degrees, 2 to 4 minutes longer. Remove tenderloins from oven and brush each with remaining glaze; let rest, uncovered, 10 minutes.  
4. While tenderloins rest, stir remaining 1⁄4 cup maple syrup and mustard into reserved 2 tablespoons glaze. Brush each tenderloin with 1 tablespoon mustard glaze. Transfer meat to carving board and slice into 1⁄4-inch-thick pieces. Serve, passing extra mustard glaze separately.  
MAPLE-GLAZED PORK TENDERLOINS WITH SMOKED PAPRIKA AND GINGER  
Substitute dry sherry for bourbon and 1⁄4 teaspoon smoked paprika and 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger for cinnamon, cloves, and cayenne pepper. Omit mustard in step 4.

TURNING THE TENDERLOIN END PIECE INTO A MEDALLION  
After cutting the tenderloins into symmetrical 1-1⁄2-inch medallions, you will inevitably have a few irregularly shaped pieces left over. The tapered end pieces of the tenderloin can be scored, folded, and tied into medallions (as shown here).  
#instructions  
1. Score tenderloin’s tapered end piece.  
2. Fold in half at incision.  
3. Tie medallion with kitchen twine, making sure top and bottom surfaces are flat.  
TYING PORK MEDALLIONS  
Thick medallions allow for more browning, but they can flop over in the pan. To prevent this, tie each piece with twine or a strip of parcooked bacon secured with two toothpicks.

MAKES 1⁄2 CUP, ENOUGH FOR 1 RECIPE PAN-SEARED OVEN-ROASTED PORK TENDERLOINS  
#ingredients  
A rasp-style grater is the best way to break down the garlic to a fine paste. Another option is to put the garlic through a press and then finish mincing it to a paste with a knife. If your garlic cloves contain green sprouts or shoots, remove the sprouts before grating—their flavor is bitter and hot. The initial cooking of the garlic off heat will prevent scorching.  
10 garlic cloves, peeled and grated to fine paste on rasp-style grater (2 tablespoons)  
2 tablespoons water  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
1⁄4 teaspoon red pepper flakes  
2 teaspoons packed light brown sugar

1⁄4 cup chopped fresh cilantro  
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces  
Salt and pepper

1. Immediately after placing pork in oven, mix garlic paste with water in small bowl. Add oil to still-hot skillet and swirl to coat; add garlic paste and cook with skillet’s residual heat, scraping bottom of skillet with wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits, until sizzling subsides, about 2 minutes. Set skillet over low heat and continue cooking, stirring frequently, until garlic is sticky, 8 to 10 minutes; set skillet aside off heat.  
2. While pork is resting, set skillet over medium heat; add pepper flakes and sugar to skillet and cook until sticky and sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute. Add lime juice, cilantro, and chives; simmer to blend flavors, 1 to 2 minutes. Add any accumulated pork juices and simmer 1 minute longer. Off heat, whisk in butter, 1 piece at a time.

MAPLE-GLAZED PORK ROAST  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
Note that you should not trim the pork of its thin layer of fat. The flavor of grade B maple syrup (sometimes called “cooking maple”) is stronger and richer than grade A, but grade A syrup will work well, too. This dish is unapologetically sweet, so we recommend side dishes that take well to the sweetness. Garlicky sautéed greens, braised cabbage, and soft polenta are good choices.  
1⁄2 cup maple syrup  
1⁄8 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
Pinch ground cloves  
Pinch cayenne pepper  
1 (2-1⁄2-pound) boneless blade-end pork loin roast, tied at even intervals along length with 5 pieces kitchen twine  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper  
2 teaspoons vegetable oil  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Stir maple syrup, cinnamon, cloves, and cayenne together in measuring cup or bowl; set aside. Pat roast dry with paper towels, then season with salt and pepper.  
2. Heat oil in 10-inch ovensafe nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking, about 3 minutes. Place roast fat side down in skillet and cook until well browned, about 3 minutes. Using tongs, rotate roast one-quarter turn and cook until well browned, about 2-1⁄2 minutes; repeat until roast is well browned on all sides. Transfer roast to large plate. Reduce heat to medium and pour off fat from skillet; add maple syrup mixture and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds (syrup will bubble immediately). Off heat, return roast to skillet; using tongs, roll to coat roast with glaze on all sides. Place skillet in oven and roast until meat registers 140 degrees, 35 to 45 minutes, using tongs to roll and spin roast to coat with glaze twice during roasting time (skillet handle will be hot). Transfer roast to carving board; set skillet aside to cool slightly to thicken glaze, about 5 minutes. Pour glaze over roast and let rest 15 minutes longer. Snip twine off roast, cut into 1⁄4-inch-thick slices, and serve.

ROAST PORK LOIN WITH APRICOT, FIG, AND PISTACHIO STUFFING  
#quantity  
SERVES 8 TO 10  
#ingredients  
If the pork is enhanced (injected with a salt solution), do not brine in step 2. Timing is important; coordinate brining and stuffing so that the pork is out of the brine and ready to be stuffed when the precooked stuffing comes out of the oven. To achieve this, begin preparing the stuffing ingredients immediately after setting the pork in the brine. Bamboo skewers, available in supermarkets, are our favorite way to fasten the roast around the stuffing. Alternatively, use poultry lacers.  
PORK AND BRINE  
1 (4-1⁄2-pound) boneless blade-end pork loin roast, trimmed  
3⁄4 cup sugar  
6 tablespoons salt  
10 garlic cloves, lightly crushed and peeled  
3 bay leaves, crumbled  
1 tablespoon allspice berries, lightly crushed  
1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns, lightly crushed  
STUFFING AND GLAZE  
7–8 ounces baguette (not sourdough), torn into rough 1-inch pieces (5 cups)  
1⁄2 cup dried apricots  
1 garlic clove, peeled  
Pinch ground cumin  
Pinch ground coriander  
Pinch ground cinnamon  
Pinch cayenne pepper  
2 tablespoons grated onion  
1⁄2 cup dried figs, halved lengthwise  
1⁄2 cup shelled pistachios, toasted and chopped coarse  
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley  
2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme  
1 teaspoon salt  
Pepper  
2 large eggs  
1⁄2 cup heavy cream  
1⁄2 cup apricot preserves  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE PORK AND BRINE: Using sharp knife, slice pork open down middle, from end to end, cutting about two-thirds of way through meat. Open pork loin like book. Carefully slice along initial cut just until pork lays flat, being careful not to cut all the way through. Pound pork loin to even 1-inch thickness.  
2. Dissolve sugar and salt in 2 quarts cold water in large container. Add garlic, bay leaves, allspice, and peppercorns; stir to combine. Submerge pork in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 1-1⁄2 to 2 hours. Remove pork from brine, pick spices off meat, and thoroughly pat pork dry with paper towels.  
3. FOR THE STUFFING AND GLAZE: Once pork is in brine, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Process half of bread pieces in food processor to crumbs with few pieces no larger than about 1⁄4 inch, about 45 seconds; transfer to large bowl and set aside. Repeat process with remaining bread pieces (you should have about 4 cups crumbs total).  
4. In now-empty food processor, process apricots, garlic, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and cayenne until finely ground, about 30 seconds; add mixture to reserved bread crumbs. Add onion, figs, pistachios, parsley, thyme, salt, and pepper to taste to bread-crumb and apricot mixture; toss until well distributed, breaking up any apricot clumps as necessary. Beat eggs and cream in bowl; pour over bread-crumb and apricot mixture and toss with hands until evenly moistened and portion of mixture holds together when pressed.  
5. On parchment paper–lined baking sheet or inverted rimmed baking sheet, form stuffing into log shape equal in length to butterflied pork. Cover stuffing with aluminum foil and bake until firm and cooked through and butterflied pork has been removed from brine and prepared for stuffing, about 45 minutes. Remove stuffing from oven; increase oven temperature to 450 degrees.  
6. While stuffing bakes, heat apricot preserves in small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until melted but not liquefied, 5 to 7 minutes. Strain through small strainer into bowl (you should have about 1⁄3 cup) and set aside; discard solids in strainer.  
7. TO STUFF AND GLAZE THE ROAST: Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet (or shallow roasting pan) lined with foil and set aside. Spoon stuffing onto center of pork. Bring sides of roast together to encase stuffing and tie with twine at 1-inch intervals. Place stuffed roast on rack, brush half of apricot glaze evenly over exposed surface of meat, and roast for 20 minutes. Remove roast from oven and, with tongs, rotate roast so that bottom side faces up. Brush exposed surface with remaining apricot glaze; return roast to oven and roast 25 minutes longer (glaze should be medium golden brown and internal temperature of both meat and stuffing should register 140 degrees). Transfer roast to carving board, tent loosely with foil, and let rest for 5 minutes. Cut off twine, slice, and serve.  
ROAST PORK LOIN WITH APRICOT, CHERRY, AND PECAN STUFFING  
Substitute 1⁄2 cup dried tart cherries for figs and 1⁄2 cup coarsely chopped toasted pecans for pistachios in stuffing mixture.  
ROAST PORK LOIN WITH APRICOT, PRUNE, AND PINE NUT STUFFING  
Substitute 1⁄2 cup pitted prunes, halved lengthwise, for figs and 1⁄2 cup coarsely chopped toasted pine nuts for pistachios in stuffing mixture.  
STUFFING A BONELESS PORK LOIN  
#instructions  
1. Slice pork open down middle, from end to end, cutting about two-thirds of way through meat. Open pork loin like book.  
2. Carefully slice along initial cut, being careful not to cut all the way through, and press pork flat.  
3. Pound roast to even 1-inch thickness. Then, mound filling evenly down center of roast.  
4. Wrap sides of pork around filling, then tie roast closed with kitchen twine at 1-inch intervals. Don’t tie roast too tight or you may squeeze out filling.

TUSCAN-STYLE GARLIC-ROSEMARY ROAST PORK LOIN  
#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
If the pork is enhanced (injected with a salt solution), do not brine in step 1, and season with salt in step 4. The roasting time is determined in part by the shape of the roast; a long, thin roast will cook faster than a roast with a large circumference. Though not traditionally served, the ribs are rich with flavor. If you’d like to serve them, increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees, untie the roast and remove the loin as directed, then scrape off the excess garlic-rosemary paste from the ribs, set them on a rimmed baking sheet, and return them to the oven for about 20 minutes, until they are brown and crisp. Slice in between bones and serve.  
PORK AND BRINE  
2-1⁄3 cups packed dark brown sugar  
1 cup salt  
10 large garlic cloves, lightly crushed and peeled  
5 sprigs fresh rosemary  
1 (4-pound) bone-in center-cut pork rib roast, trimmed  
1 tablespoon olive oil  
1 cup dry white wine  
1 teaspoon pepper  
GARLIC-ROSEMARY PASTE  
8 garlic cloves, minced  
1-1⁄2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary  
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil  
1 teaspoon pepper  
Pinch salt  
JUS  
1 shallot, minced  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary  
1-3⁄4 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces and softened  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE PORK AND BRINE: Using boning knife, carefully cut meat away from rack of bones. Dissolve sugar and salt in 2 quarts cold water in large container. Stir in garlic and rosemary. Submerge pork and bones in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 1-1⁄2 to 2 hours.  
2. FOR THE GARLIC-ROSEMARY PASTE: While pork brines, mix garlic, rosemary, olive oil, pepper, and salt together in bowl to form paste; set aside.  
3. Remove meat and ribs from brine and thoroughly pat dry with paper towels. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium heat until just smoking, about 4 minutes. Place roast fat side down in skillet and cook until well browned, about 8 minutes. Transfer roast browned side up to carving board and set aside to cool. Pour off fat from skillet and add wine; increase heat to high and bring to boil, scraping bottom of skillet with wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits. Set skillet off heat.  
4. Make lengthwise incision in pork loin and spread meat flat. Rub with one-third of garlic-rosemary paste, rub remaining paste on cut side of ribs, and tie meat back to ribs. Season browned side of roast with pepper and set roast rib side down in flameproof roasting pan. Pour reserved wine and browned bits from skillet into roasting pan. Roast, basting loin with pan drippings every 20 minutes, until meat registers 140 degrees, 65 to 80 minutes. (If wine evaporates, add about 1⁄2 cup water to roasting pan to prevent scorching.) Transfer roast to clean carving board and tent loosely with aluminum foil; let rest about 15 minutes.  
5. FOR THE JUS: While roast rests, spoon off most of fat from roasting pan and place over 2 burners at high heat. Add shallot and rosemary; scrape bottom of pan with wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits and boil until liquid is reduced by half and shallot has softened, about 2 minutes. Add broth and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, about 8 minutes. Add any accumulated pork juices and cook 1 minute longer. Off heat, whisk in butter; strain jus into serving bowl.  
6. Snip twine off roast and remove meat from bones. Set meat browned side up on carving board and cut into 1⁄4-inch-thick slices. Serve, passing jus separately.  
GARLIC-ROSEMARY ROAST PORK LOIN WITH ROASTED POTATOES  
Reduce wine to 3⁄4 cup and omit shallot, rosemary, chicken broth, and butter. When pork has roasted 15 minutes, quarter 2 pounds red potatoes; toss with 2 tablespoons olive oil in bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste. After pork has roasted 30 minutes, add potatoes to roasting pan; stir to coat potatoes with pan juices. After transferring roast to carving board, turn potato pieces with wide metal spatula and spread them in even layer. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees and return potatoes to oven; continue to roast until tender and browned, 5 to 15 minutes longer. Serve potatoes with roast.  
GARLIC-ROSEMARY ROAST PORK LOIN WITH FENNEL  
Trim 2 fennel bulbs of stalks and fronds; finely chop 2 teaspoons fronds. Halve, core, and cut each bulb lengthwise into eighths. Toss fennel with 1 tablespoon olive oil in medium bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste. Add 1 teaspoon finely chopped fennel seeds and chopped fennel fronds to garlic-rosemary paste. Reduce wine to 3⁄4 cup and omit shallot, rosemary, chicken broth, and butter. Add fennel to roasting pan along with wine. After transferring roast to carving board, return fennel to oven; continue to roast until tender, 5 to 15 minutes. Serve fennel with roast.  
BONING A PORK LOIN  
#instructions  
1. Position roast so bones are perpendicular to cutting board. Starting from far end and working toward you, make series of small, easy strokes with boning knife between meat and bones.  
2. Gradually cut along curved rib bones down to backbone until meat is free from bones.  
BUTTERFLYING, SEASONING, AND TYING A PORK LOIN  
#instructions  
1. With fat side of roast down, slice through center of entire length of meat, stopping 1 inch shy of edge. Spread meat flat.  
2. Rub one-third of garlic-rosemary paste mixture in even layer on one side of cut, leaving 1⁄2 inch on each end bare.  
3. Spread remaining garlic-rosemary paste mixture evenly along bones from where meat was cut, leaving 1⁄2 inch on each end bare.  
4. Fold meat back together and tie meat on bones exactly from where it was cut with 7 individual lengths of kitchen twine.

HERB-CRUSTED PORK ROAST  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
If the pork is enhanced (injected with a salt solution), do not brine in step 1, and season with salt in step 4. Note that you should not trim the pork of its layer of fat. Do not substitute dried thyme for fresh or the herb crust will be dry and dusty tasting. The roasting time will vary widely depending on the thickness of the meat.  
1 (2-1⁄2- to 3-pound) boneless center-cut pork loin roast  
Salt and pepper  
1⁄4 cup sugar  
1 slice hearty white sandwich bread, torn into pieces  
1 ounce Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese, grated (1⁄2 cup)  
1 shallot, minced  
1⁄4 cup plus 2 teaspoons olive oil  
1⁄3 cup packed fresh parsley or basil  
2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme  
1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary or 1⁄2 teaspoon dried  
1 large garlic clove, minced  
#instructions  
1. Lightly score fat cap on pork, making 1⁄4-inch crosshatch pattern. Create pocket by inserting knife 1⁄2 inch from end of roast and cutting along side of pork stopping 1⁄2 inch shorter of other end. Pull open roast and use gentle strokes to cut deeper pocket. Dissolve 1⁄4 cup salt and sugar in 2 quarts cold water in large container. Submerge pork in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 1-1⁄2 to 2 hours. Remove roast from brine and thoroughly pat dry with paper towels.  
2. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Pulse bread in food processor until coarsely ground, about 16 pulses (you should have 1 cup crumbs). Transfer crumbs to medium bowl (do not wash food processor bowl) and add 2 tablespoons Parmesan, shallot, 1 tablespoon oil, 1⁄8 teaspoon salt, and 1⁄8 teaspoon pepper. Using fork, toss mixture until crumbs are evenly coated with oil.  
3. Add parsley, thyme, rosemary, garlic, remaining 6 tablespoons Parmesan, 3 tablespoons oil, 1⁄8 teaspoon salt, and 1⁄8 teaspoon pepper to now-empty food processor and process until smooth, about 12 pulses. Transfer herb paste to bowl.  
4. Spread 1⁄4 cup herb paste inside roast and tie. Season roast with pepper.  
5. Heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add roast, fat side down, and brown on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes, lowering heat if fat begins to smoke. Transfer roast to wire rack set in aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet.  
6. Snip and remove twine from roast; discard twine. Spread remaining herb paste over roast and top with bread-crumb mixture. Transfer baking sheet with roast to oven and cook until thickest part of roast registers 145 degrees, 50 to 75 minutes. Remove roast from oven and let rest for 10 minutes. Using spatula and meat fork, transfer roast to carving board, taking care not to squeeze juices out of pocket in roast. Cut roast into 1⁄2-inch-thick slices and serve.  
TO MAKE AHEAD: Roast can be brined, stuffed, and tied 1 day ahead, but don’t prepare bread-crumb topping until you are ready to cook.  
HERB-CRUSTED PORK ROAST WITH MUSTARD AND CARAWAY  
Substitute 1 tablespoon minced garlic for shallot in bread-crumb mixture, replace rosemary with 4 teaspoons whole grain mustard and 1 tablespoon toasted caraway seeds, and reduce oil in step 3 to 2 tablespoons.  
PREPARING HERB-CRUSTED PORK ROAST  
#instructions  
1. Starting 1⁄2 inch from end of roast, insert knife into middle of roast, with blade parallel to counter.  
2. Cut along side of pork, stopping 1⁄2 inch short of other end. Pull open roast and use gentle strokes to cut deeper pocket.  
3. Spread 1⁄4 cup herb paste evenly into pocket, using spatula and fingers to make sure paste reaches corners of pocket.  
4. Return roast to original shape and tie at even intervals along its length with 3 pieces of kitchen twine.

INDOOR PULLED PORK WITH SWEET AND TANGY BARBECUE SAUCE  
#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
Boneless pork butt roast is often labeled Boston butt in the supermarket. If the pork is enhanced (injected with a salt solution), do not brine in step 1. Sweet paprika may be substituted for the smoked paprika. Covering the pork with parchment and then foil prevents the acidic mustard from eating holes in the foil. Serve the pork on hamburger rolls with pickle chips and thinly sliced onion. Lexington Vinegar Barbecue Sauce or South Carolina Mustard Barbecue Sauce (recipes follow) can be substituted for the Sweet and Tangy Barbecue Sauce. Alternatively, use 2 cups of your favorite barbecue sauce thinned with 1⁄2 cup of the defatted pork cooking liquid in step 5.  
PORK  
Salt and pepper  
6 tablespoons sugar  
3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons liquid smoke  
1 (5-pound) boneless pork butt roast, cut in half horizontally  
1⁄4 cup yellow mustard  
2 tablespoons smoked paprika  
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper

1⁄2 teaspoon pepper  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE PORK: Dissolve 1⁄4 cup salt, 1⁄4 cup sugar, and 3 tablespoons liquid smoke in 2 quarts cold water in large container. Submerge pork in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 1-1⁄2 to 2 hours.  
2. While pork brines, combine mustard and remaining 2 teaspoons liquid smoke in bowl; set aside. Combine 2 teaspoons salt, 2 tablespoons pepper, remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, paprika, and cayenne in second bowl; set aside. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees.  
3. Remove pork from brine and thoroughly pat dry with paper towels. Rub mustard mixture over entire surface of each piece of pork. Sprinkle entire surface of each piece with spice mixture. Place pork on wire rack set in aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet. Place piece of parchment paper over pork, then cover with sheet of aluminum foil, sealing edges to prevent moisture from escaping. Roast pork for 3 hours.  
4. Remove pork from oven; remove and discard foil and parchment. Carefully pour off liquid in bottom of baking sheet into fat separator and reserve for sauce. Return pork to oven and cook, uncovered, until well browned and tender and internal temperature registers 200 degrees, about 1-1⁄2 hours. Transfer pork to serving dish, tent loosely with foil, and let rest for 20 minutes.  
5. FOR THE SAUCE: While pork rests, pour 1⁄2 cup defatted cooking liquid from fat separator into medium bowl; whisk in sauce ingredients.  
6. TO SERVE: Using 2 forks, shred pork into bite-size pieces. (Shredded and sauced pork can be cooled, tightly covered, and refrigerated for up to 2 days. Reheat gently before serving.) Toss with 1 cup sauce and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve, passing remaining sauce separately.

MEXICAN PULLED PORK (CARNITAS)  
#quantity  
SERVES 6  
#ingredients  

PORK  
1 (3-1⁄2- to 4-pound) boneless pork butt roast, fat cap trimmed to 1⁄8 inch thick and cut into 2-inch chunks  
2 cups water  
1 onion, peeled and halved  
2 tablespoons lime juice  
1 teaspoon dried oregano  
1 teaspoon ground cumin  
2 bay leaves  
Salt and pepper  
1 orange, halved  
TORTILLAS AND GARNISHES  
18 (6-inch) corn tortillas, warmed  
Lime wedges  
Minced white or red onion  
Fresh cilantro  
Thinly sliced radishes  
Sour cream  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Combine pork, water, onion, lime juice, oregano, cumin, bay leaves, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1⁄2 teaspoon pepper in Dutch oven (liquid should just barely cover meat). Juice orange into bowl and remove any seeds (you should have about 1⁄3 cup juice). Add juice and spent orange halves to pot. Bring mixture to simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Cover pot and transfer to oven; cook until meat is soft and falls apart when prodded with fork, about 2 hours, flipping pieces of meat once during cooking.  
2. Remove pot from oven and turn oven to broil. Using slotted spoon, transfer pork to bowl; remove orange halves, onion, and bay leaves from cooking liquid and discard (do not skim fat from liquid). Place pot over high heat (use caution, as handles will be very hot) and simmer liquid, stirring frequently, until thick and syrupy (heat-resistant spatula should leave wide trail when dragged through glaze), 8 to 12 minutes. You should have about 1 cup reduced liquid.  
3. Using 2 forks, pull each piece of pork in half. Fold in reduced liquid; season with salt and pepper to taste. Spread pork in even layer on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet or on broiler pan (meat should cover almost entire surface of rack or broiler pan). Place baking sheet on lower-middle rack and broil until top of meat is well browned (but not charred) and edges are slightly crisp, 5 to 8 minutes. Using wide metal spatula, flip pieces of meat and continue to broil until top is well browned and edges are slightly crisp, 5 to 8 minutes longer. Serve with warm tortillas and garnishes.

SPICY MEXICAN SHREDDED PORK (TINGA) TOSTADAS  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
Boneless pork butt roast is often labeled Boston butt in the supermarket. The trimmed pork should weigh about 1-1⁄2 pounds. Tinga is traditionally served on tostadas (crisp fried corn tortillas), but you can also use the meat in tacos and burritos or simply served over rice. Make sure to buy tortillas made only with corn, lime, and salt—preservatives will compromise quality. We prefer the complex flavor of chipotle powder, but two minced canned chipotle chiles can be used in its place.  
TINGA  
2 pounds boneless pork butt roast, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces  
2 onions, 1 quartered and 1 chopped fine  
5 garlic cloves, 3 peeled and smashed and 2 minced  
4 sprigs fresh thyme  
Salt  
2 tablespoons olive oil  
1⁄2 teaspoon dried oregano  
1 (14.5-ounce) can tomato sauce  
1 tablespoon ground chipotle powder  
2 bay leaves  
TOSTADAS  
3⁄4 cup vegetable oil  
12 (6-inch) corn tortillas  
Salt  
GARNISHES  
Queso fresco or feta cheese  
Fresh cilantro  
Sour cream  
Diced avocado  
Lime wedges  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE TINGA: Bring pork, quartered onion, smashed garlic, thyme sprigs, 1 teaspoon salt, and 6 cups water to simmer in large saucepan over medium-high heat, skimming off any foam that rises to surface. Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover, and cook until pork is tender, 1-1⁄4 to 1-1⁄2 hours. Drain pork, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid. Discard onion, garlic, and thyme sprigs. Return pork to saucepan and, using potato masher, mash until shredded into rough 1⁄2-inch pieces; set aside. (Pork can be prepared through step 1 and refrigerated for 2 days.)  
2. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add shredded pork, chopped onion, and oregano; cook, stirring often, until pork is well browned and crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  
3. Stir in tomato sauce, reserved pork cooking liquid, chipotle powder, and bay leaves; simmer until almost all liquid has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove and discard bay leaves and season with salt to taste.  
4. FOR THE TOSTADAS: Heat oil in 8-inch skillet over medium heat to 350 degrees. Using fork, poke center of each tortilla 3 or 4 times. Fry one at a time, holding metal potato masher in upright position on top of tortilla to keep it submerged, until crisp and lightly browned, 45 to 60 seconds (no flipping is necessary). Drain on paper towel–lined plate and season with salt to taste. Repeat with remaining tortillas. (Tostadas can be made up to 1 day in advance and stored in airtight container.)  
5. TO SERVE: Spoon small amount of shredded pork onto center of each tostada and serve, passing garnishes separately.

SPICY MEXICAN SHREDDED PORK TOSTADAS WITH HOMEMADE CHORIZO  
#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
Increase amount of pork to 3 pounds (2-1⁄2 pounds after trimming). Using two-thirds of pork (1-1⁄2 pounds), follow recipe as directed in step 1. To make chorizo, place remaining pork pieces on large plate in single layer and freeze until firm but still pliable, about 15 minutes. Once firm, toss pork with 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar, 1-1⁄4 teaspoons chili powder, 1 small minced garlic clove, 1 teaspoon salt, 3⁄4 teaspoon hot paprika, 3⁄4 teaspoon ground chipotle powder, 3⁄4 teaspoon dried oregano, 1⁄4 teaspoon pepper, and 1⁄8 teaspoon ground cumin in medium bowl. Pulse half of chorizo mixture in food processor until meat is finely chopped, 8 to 10 pulses. Transfer to bowl and repeat with remaining chorizo mixture. In step 2, heat oil as directed and add chorizo mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly crisp and no longer pink, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer meat to paper towel–lined plate, leaving rendered fat in skillet. Proceed with recipe as directed, using rendered fat to cook shredded pork and returning chorizo mixture to skillet along with tomato sauce in step 3.

OVEN-BARBECUED SPARERIBS  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
To make this recipe, you will need a baking stone. It’s fine if the ribs overlap slightly on the wire rack. Removing the surface fat keeps the ribs from being too greasy and removing the membrane from the ribs allows the smoke to penetrate both sides of the racks and also makes the ribs easier to eat. Note that the ribs must be coated with the rub and refrigerated at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours ahead of cooking. Be careful when opening the crimped foil to add the juice, as hot steam and smoke will billow out. Serve ribs with barbecue sauce, if desired.  
6 tablespoons yellow mustard  
2 tablespoons ketchup  
3 garlic cloves, minced  
3 tablespoons packed brown sugar  
1-1⁄2 tablespoons kosher salt  
1 tablespoon sweet paprika  
1 tablespoon chili powder  
2 teaspoons pepper  
1⁄2 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
2 (2-1⁄2- to 3-pound) racks St. Louis–style spareribs, trimmed, membrane removed, and each rack cut in half  
1⁄4 cup finely ground Lapsang Souchong tea leaves (from about 10 tea bags, or 1⁄2 cup loose tea leaves ground to a powder in a spice grinder)  
1⁄2 cup apple juice  
#instructions  
1. Combine mustard, ketchup, and garlic in bowl; combine sugar, salt, paprika, chili powder, pepper, and cayenne in separate bowl. Spread mustard mixture in thin, even layer over both sides of ribs; coat both sides with spice mixture, then wrap ribs in plastic and refrigerate for 8 to 24 hours.  
2. Transfer ribs from refrigerator to freezer for 45 minutes. Adjust oven racks to lowest and upper-middle positions (at least 5 inches below broiler). Place baking stone on lower rack; heat oven to 500 degrees. Sprinkle ground tea evenly over bottom of rimmed baking sheet; set wire rack in baking sheet. Place ribs meat side up on rack and cover with heavy-duty aluminum foil, crimping edges tightly to seal. Place baking sheet on stone and roast ribs for 30 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 250 degrees, leaving oven door open for 1 minute to cool. While oven is open, carefully open 1 corner of foil and pour apple juice into bottom of baking sheet; reseal foil. Continue to roast until meat is very tender and begins to pull away from bones, about 1-1⁄2 hours. (Begin to check ribs after 1 hour; leave loosely covered with foil for remaining cooking time.)  
3. Remove foil and carefully flip racks bone side up; place baking sheet on upper-middle rack. Turn on broiler; cook ribs until well browned and crispy in spots, 5 to 10 minutes. Flip ribs meat side up and cook until second side is well browned and crispy, 5 to 7 minutes more. Cool for at least 10 minutes before cutting into individual ribs. Serve with barbecue sauce, if desired.  
REMOVING THE MEMBRANE FROM THE RIB RACK  
For Oven-Barbecued Spareribs, we recommend removing the thin membrane that lines the concave side of the rib rack. The ribs are easier to manipulate (and eat), and the smoke penetrates both sides of the rack directly.  
#instructions  
1. Insert spoon handle between membrane and ribs to loosen slightly.  
2. Using paper towel, grasp loosened membrane and pull away gently to remove.

CHINESE BARBECUED PORK  
#quantity  
SERVES 6  
#ingredients  
Boneless pork butt roast is often labeled Boston butt in the supermarket. The pork will release liquid and fat during the cooking process, so be careful when removing the pan from the oven. If you don’t have a wire rack that fits in a rimmed baking sheet, substitute a broiler pan, although the meat may not darken as much. Pay close attention to the meat when broiling—you are looking for it to darken and caramelize, not blacken. Do not use a drawer broiler—the heat source will be too close to the meat. Instead, increase the oven temperature in step 5 to 500 degrees and cook for 8 to 12 minutes before glazing and 6 to 8 minutes once the glaze has been applied; flip meat and repeat on second side. This recipe can be made with boneless country-style ribs, but the meat will be slightly drier and less flavorful. To use ribs, reduce the uncovered cooking time in step 4 to 20 minutes and increase the broiling and glazing times in step 5 by 2 to 3 minutes per side. This dish is best served with rice and a vegetable side dish. Leftover pork makes an excellent addition to fried rice or an Asian noodle soup.  
4 pounds boneless pork butt roast, halved lengthwise, each half turned on its side, cut into 8 strips, and trimmed  
1⁄2 cup sugar  
1⁄2 cup soy sauce  
6 tablespoons hoisin sauce  
1⁄4 cup dry sherry  
2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger  
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
1 teaspoon five-spice powder  
1⁄4 teaspoon ground white pepper  
1⁄3 cup honey  
1⁄4 cup ketchup  
#instructions  
1. Using fork, prick pork 10 to 12 times on each side. Place pork in 2-gallon plastic zipper-lock bag. Combine sugar, soy sauce, hoisin, sherry, ginger, oil, garlic, five-spice powder, and pepper in medium bowl. Measure out 1⁄2 cup marinade and set aside. Pour remaining marinade into bag with pork. Press out as much air as possible; seal bag. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours.  
2. While meat marinates, combine honey and ketchup with reserved marinade in small saucepan. Cook glaze over medium heat until syrupy and reduced to 1 cup, 4 to 6 minutes.  
3. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Set wire rack in aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet and spray with vegetable oil spray.  
4. Remove pork from marinade, letting any excess drip off, and place on wire rack. Pour 1⁄4 cup water into bottom of pan. Cover pan with heavy-duty foil, crimping edges tightly to seal. Cook pork for 20 minutes. Remove foil and continue to cook until edges of pork begin to brown, 40 to 45 minutes.  
5. Turn on broiler. Broil pork until evenly caramelized, 7 to 9 minutes. Remove pan from oven and brush pork with half of glaze; broil until deep mahogany color, 3 to 5 minutes. Using tongs, flip meat and broil until other side caramelizes, 7 to 9 minutes. Brush meat with remaining glaze and continue to broil until second side is deep mahogany, 3 to 5 minutes. Cool for at least 10 minutes, then cut into thin strips and serve.  
BUTCHERING PORK BUTT  
Pork butts are usually about 4 inches thick. If using a pork butt that is thinner than 4 inches, cut into 6 strips instead of 8.  
#instructions  
1. Cut roast in half lengthwise.  
2. Turn each half on cut side and slice lengthwise into 4 equal pieces.  
3. Trim excess hard, waxy fat, leaving some fat to render while cooking.

SORGHUM-GLAZED COUNTRY HAM  
#quantity  
SERVES 30  
#ingredients  
If using an older ham, scrub mold off with a food-grade scrub brush (such as a vegetable brush), under running water. Not removing the hock from the ham makes for a nicer presentation, but if desired, use a hack saw to remove the hock so that the ham fits more easily into the pot (this can also be done by your butcher). To soak a hock-on ham, we found a large clean cooler to be an ideal soaking vessel.  
1 (14- to 15-pound) country ham  
3 carrots, cut into large chunks  
3 celery ribs, cut into large chunks  
2 onions, cut into large chunks  
6 sprigs fresh thyme or fresh rosemary  
1⁄2 cup sorghum or packed brown sugar  
#instructions  
1. Place ham in stockpot and cover with water. Soak ham, changing water at least daily, to release salt and rehydrate ham, about 36 hours for hams aged 6 to 12 months and 3 days for hams aged over a year.  
2. Bring large kettle of water to boil. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Drain ham; discard soaking water. Cover bottom of roasting pan with large piece of aluminum foil (foil should be long enough to form tent over ham). Arrange carrots and celery in even layer over foil, tucking onion chunks and thyme in between. Set ham over vegetable bed, fat side up. Place pan in oven. Pour boiling water halfway up pan sides; pull foil around ham, forming loose tent. Bake until thickest part of ham registers 125 to 130 degrees, 2-1⁄2 to 3 hours.  
3. Remove pan from oven (cool ham slightly, if necessary). Carefully remove skin with knife, leaving 1⁄4-inch layer of fat. Score diamond pattern into fat, if desired, then brush with sorghum. Remove vegetables and cooking liquid from roasting pan, return ham to pan; bake until temperature registers 145 to 150 degrees (depending on desired crispness), 30 minutes to 1 hour longer. Transfer to a carving board. Cool slightly; carve into thin slices and serve.

2. Dissolve sugar and salt in 2 gallons cold water in large container; stir in garlic, peppercorns, and bay leaves. Submerge ham in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 8 to 24 hours.  
3. Set large disposable roasting pan on baking sheet for extra support; place flat wire rack in roasting pan. Remove ham from brine and thoroughly pat dry with paper towels. Place ham, wide cut side down, on rack. (If using sirloin end, place ham skin side up.) Let ham stand, uncovered, at room temperature for 1 hour.  
4. FOR THE RUB: Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 500 degrees. Process all rub ingredients in food processor until mixture forms smooth paste, about 30 seconds. Rub all sides of ham with paste.  
5. Roast ham at 500 degrees for 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue to roast, brushing ham with glaze every 45 minutes, until ham registers 145 to 150 degrees, about 2-1⁄2 hours longer. Transfer to carving board, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 30 to 40 minutes. Carve and serve.

GLAZED SPIRAL-SLICED HAM  
#quantity  
SERVES 12 TO 14, WITH LEFTOVERS  
#ingredients  
You can bypass the 90-minute soaking time, but the heating time will increase to 18 to 20 minutes per pound for a cold ham. If there is a tear or hole in the ham’s inner covering, wrap it in several layers of plastic wrap before soaking it in hot water. Instead of using the plastic oven bag, the ham may be placed cut side down in the roasting pan and covered tightly with foil, but you will need to add 3 to 4 minutes per pound to the heating time. If using an oven bag, be sure to cut slits in the bag so it does not burst. We’ve included two optional glazes.  
1 (7- to 10-pound) spiral-sliced bone-in half ham  
1 large plastic oven bag  
1 recipe glaze (recipes follow)  
#instructions  
1. Leaving ham’s inner plastic or foil covering intact, place ham in large container and cover with hot tap water; set aside for 45 minutes. Drain and cover again with hot tap water; set aside for another 45 minutes.  
2. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 250 degrees. Unwrap ham; remove and discard plastic disk covering bone. Place ham in oven bag. Gather top of bag tightly so bag fits snugly around ham, tie bag, and trim excess plastic. Set ham cut side down in large roasting pan and cut 4 slits in top of bag with paring knife.  
3. Bake ham until center registers 100 degrees, 1 to 1-1⁄2 hours (about 10 minutes per pound).  
4. Remove ham from oven and increase oven temperature to 350 degrees. Cut open oven bag and roll back sides to expose ham. Brush ham with one-third of glaze and return to oven until glaze becomes sticky, about 10 minutes (if glaze is too thick to brush, return to heat to loosen).  
5. Remove ham from oven, transfer to carving board, and brush entire ham with one-third of glaze. Let ham rest, tented loosely with aluminum foil, for 15 minutes. While ham rests, heat remaining one-third of glaze with 4 to 6 tablespoons of ham juices until it forms thick but fluid sauce. Carve and serve ham, passing sauce at table.

SIMPLE ROASTED RACK OF LAMB  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
Have your butcher french the racks for you; inevitably, the ribs will need some cleaning up, but at least the bulk of the work will be done. Should you choose to make an accompanying pan sauce (recipes follow), have all the ingredients ready before browning the lamb and begin the sauce just as the lamb goes into the oven. This way, the sauce will be ready with the meat.  
2 (1-1⁄4- to 1-1⁄2-pound) racks of lamb (each 8 to 9 ribs), frenched and trimmed  
Salt and pepper  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
1 recipe pan sauce (optional) (recipes follow)  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position, place rimmed baking sheet on oven rack, and heat oven to 425 degrees.  
2. Season lamb with salt and pepper. Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over high heat until shimmering. Place racks of lamb in skillet, meat side down in the center of the pan, with ribs facing outwards; cook until well browned and nice crust has formed on surface, about 4 minutes. Using tongs, stand racks up in skillet, leaning them against each other to brown bottoms; cook until bottom sides have browned, about 2 minutes longer.  
3. Transfer lamb to preheated baking sheet. (Begin pan sauce, if making.) Roast until center of each rack registers about 130 to 135 degrees (for medium), 12 to 15 minutes. Tent loosely with aluminum foil and let rest about 10 minutes. Carve, slicing between each rib into individual chops, and season with salt and pepper to taste or serve with an accompanying sauce.

GARLIC-ROASTED LEG OF LAMB  
#quantity  
SERVES 8 TO 10  
#ingredients  
Look for rolled, boneless leg of lamb wrapped in netting, not butterflied and wrapped on a tray. The desirable cut is the “shank end,” which is the whole boneless leg without the sirloin muscle attached. If only bone-in or semiboneless leg is available, ask your butcher to remove the bones for you. Plan on spending about 30 minutes trimming the lamb of fat and silver skin. This advance work is well worth the effort; your roasts will present elegantly and have a much cleaner flavor. (That said, even 10 minutes of trimming will improve the taste dramatically). If you opt for the 30-minute trim, you will have enough meat scraps left over to make the Roasted Garlic Jus.  
LAMB AND BRINE  
1⁄4 cup sugar  
2 tablespoons salt  
12 garlic cloves, crushed  
1 (5- to 7-pound) boneless leg of domestic lamb with sirloin muscle removed, separated into 3 smaller roasts, trimmed, and scored  
GARLIC-PARSLEY PASTE  
2 garlic heads, outer papery skins removed and top third of head cut off and discarded  
1 tablespoon olive oil  
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley  
Salt and pepper  
3 tablespoons vegetable oil  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE LAMB AND BRINE: Dissolve sugar and salt in 2 quarts water in large container; stir in crushed garlic. Submerge lamb in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 2 hours.  
2. FOR THE PASTE: While lamb brines, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Place garlic heads cut side up on sheet of aluminum foil and drizzle with olive oil. Wrap foil tightly around garlic; place on baking sheet and roast until cloves are very soft and golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. When cool enough to handle, squeeze garlic head to remove cloves from skins. Mash cloves into paste with side of chef’s knife. Combine 2 tablespoons garlic paste and parsley in small bowl. (Reserve remaining paste for Roasted Garlic Jus, if making; recipe follows.)  
3. Remove lamb from brine and thoroughly pat dry with paper towels. Rub surface of lamb with garlic paste, roll, and tie with kitchen twine at 1-inch intervals. Season each roast with salt and pepper.  
4. Heat vegetable oil in 12-inch ovensafe skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Place lamb roasts in skillet and cook until well browned on all sides, about 12 minutes total. Place skillet in oven and roast until each roast registers 120 to 125 degrees (for medium-rare) or 130 to 135 degrees (for medium). (Roasting time will range from 8 to 25 minutes depending on size of roasts; begin checking after 7 minutes and transfer each roast to platter as it reaches desired temperature.) Let lamb rest, tented loosely with foil, about 15 minutes. Snip off twine, cut into 1⁄4-inch slices, and serve.  
TO MAKE AHEAD: Lamb can be trimmed, brined, rubbed with paste, and tied, then stored overnight in refrigerator (do not season meat). Allow lamb to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before proceeding with recipe.

#title  
ROASTED GARLIC JUS  
#quantity  
MAKES ABOUT 2 CUPS  
#ingredients  
Trimming the lamb into three roasts will yield a few large, meaty scraps, which we recommend using to make an accompanying jus. (Discard smaller pieces of fat and silver skin.) Start the jus while the lamb is in the oven, and finish simmering it while the lamb rests. Keep it warm in a small saucepan and return to a simmer just before serving.  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
1–1-1⁄2 cups meaty lamb scraps, trimmed of fat and cut into 1-inch pieces  
1 onion, chopped  
1⁄2 cup dry white wine  
4 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
2 tablespoons garlic paste (reserved from Garlic-Roasted Leg of Lamb)  
1 teaspoon red wine vinegar  
Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering; add lamb and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until lamb is well browned and onion is soft and golden, about 8 minutes (reduce heat to medium if pan becomes very dark). Add wine and simmer until reduced by half, about 1 minute, scraping bottom of pot with wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits. Add broth and garlic paste; simmer until reduced by half, 15 to 20 minutes. Add any accumulated lamb juices from platter. Strain jus through fine-mesh strainer into small saucepan; add vinegar and serve with sliced lamb, or keep warm until needed.  
PREPARING THE LAMB  
This method takes about 30 minutes. Instead, you can simply separate the lamb into 3 roasts (illustration 1) and spend just 10 minutes trimming, concentrating on the exterior fat and gristle, then cut a deep, lengthwise pocket into each roast, rub the paste on the interior surface, and tie the roasts.  
#instructions  
1. Following natural seams (delineated by lines of fat), separate into 3 smaller roasts, using sharp boning knife as needed.  
2. Trim visible fat and gristle from exterior of each roast. Penetrate deeper to remove interior pockets of gristle, fat, and silver skin. (Roasts will open up and flatten slightly.)  
3. As you trim meat, remove any large, meaty scraps that come loose from larger pieces. Reserve these for making Roasted Garlic Jus , if desired.  
4. Lightly score inside of each roast, making 1⁄4-inch-deep cuts spaced 1 inch apart in crosshatch pattern.  
5. Rub scored surface of brined lamb with garlic-parsley paste, working paste into grooves.  
6. Roll into compact roast, tucking in flaps, to form log shape. Tie with kitchen twine at 1-inch intervals.

ROAST BONELESS LEG OF LAMB WITH GARLIC, HERB, AND BREAD-CRUMB CRUST  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  

1 slice hearty white sandwich bread  
1⁄4 cup olive oil  
1⁄4 cup minced fresh parsley  
3 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary  
2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme  
3 garlic cloves, peeled  
1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated (1⁄2 cup)  
1 (3-1⁄2- to 4-pound) boneless half leg of lamb, untied, trimmed, and pounded to even 3⁄4-inch thickness, room temperature  
Salt and pepper  
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Meanwhile, pulse bread in food processor until coarsely ground, about 10 pulses (you should have about 1 cup crumbs). Transfer to bowl and set aside. In now-empty food processor, process 1 teaspoon oil, parsley, rosemary, thyme, and garlic until minced, scraping down bowl with rubber spatula as necessary, about 1 minute. Transfer 1-1⁄2 tablespoons herb mixture to bowl and reserve. Scrape remaining mixture into bowl of bread crumbs; stir in Parmesan and 1 tablespoon oil and set aside.  
2. Lay lamb with rough interior side (which was against bone) facing up; rub with 2 teaspoons oil and season with salt and pepper. Spread reserved 1-1⁄2 tablespoons herb mixture evenly over meat, leaving 1-inch border around edge. Roll and tie roast. Season roast with salt and pepper, then rub with 1 tablespoon oil.  
3. Place wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking, about 3 minutes. Sear lamb until well browned on all sides, about 8 minutes; then, using tongs, stand roast on each end to sear, about 30 seconds per end. Transfer to rack and roast until meat registers 120 degrees, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer lamb to carving board; remove and discard twine. Brush lamb exterior with mustard, then carefully press bread-crumb mixture onto top and sides of roast with hands, pressing firmly to form a solid, even coating that adheres to the meat. Return coated roast to rack; roast until meat registers 130 to 135 degrees (for medium), 15 to 25 minutes longer. Transfer meat to carving board, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Cut into 1⁄2-inch-thick slices and serve.

GREEK-STYLE LAMB PITA SANDWICHES  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
Since the yogurt and cucumbers in the TZATZIKI SAUCE need to drain for 30 minutes, start making the sauce before the patties. For the patties, we prefer the flavor of fresh oregano, but 1 teaspoon of dried can be substituted. The skillet may appear crowded when you begin cooking the patties, but they will shrink slightly as they cook. If using pocketless pitas, heat them in a single layer on a baking sheet in a 350-degree oven for 5 minutes. Do not cut top quarters off pocketless pitas; instead, use a portion of a fifth pita to create crumbs in step 1. When cooking the patties, use a splatter screen to keep the mess to a minimum.  
LAMB PATTIES  
4 (8-inch) pita breads  
1⁄2 onion, chopped coarse  
1 tablespoon minced fresh oregano  
4 teaspoons lemon juice  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper  
1 pound ground lamb  
2 teaspoons vegetable oil  
ACCOMPANIMENTS  
1 recipe Tzatziki Sauce  
1 large tomato, cored and sliced thin  
2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce  
2 ounces feta cheese, crumbled (1⁄2 cup)  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE LAMB PATTIES: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Cut top quarter off each pita bread. Tear quarters into 1-inch pieces. (You should have 3⁄4 cup pita pieces.) Stack pitas and tightly wrap with aluminum foil. Process pita bread pieces, onion, oregano, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper in food processor until smooth paste forms, about 30 seconds. Transfer bread mixture to large bowl; add lamb and gently mix with hands until thoroughly combined. Divide mixture into 12 equal pieces and roll into balls. Gently flatten balls into round disks about 1⁄2 inch thick and 2-1⁄2 inches in diameter. (Patties can be prepared through step 1 and refrigerated for up to 1 day or frozen before cooking as directed in step 2. Frozen patties should be thawed in refrigerator prior to cooking.)  
2. Place foil-wrapped pitas directly on oven rack and heat for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add patties and cook until well browned and crust forms, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip patties, reduce heat to medium, and cook until well browned and crust forms on second side, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer patties to paper towel–lined plate.  
3. Using soupspoon, spread 1⁄4 cup Tzatziki Sauce inside each pita. Divide patties evenly among pitas; fill each sandwich with tomato slices, 1⁄2 cup shredded lettuce, and 2 tablespoons feta. Serve immediately.  
GREEK-STYLE LAMB PITA SANDWICHES WITH BEEF  
Decrease lemon juice to 1 tablespoon, increase oregano to 2 tablespoons, increase garlic to 3 cloves, and increase oil to 1 tablespoon. Substitute 1 pound 80 percent lean ground chuck for lamb.  
GRILLED GREEK-STYLE LAMB PITA SANDWICHES  
The grill imparts a smoky flavor to the meat and pitas in this variation.  
1A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled three-quarters full with charcoal (4-1⁄2 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place and cover. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.  
1B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and reduce other burner(s) to medium-high.  
2. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place patties on hotter side of grill, cover (if using gas), and cook, turning once, until well browned and crust forms on each side, 8 to 12 minutes. Transfer patties to plate. Place pitas in single layer on hotter side of grill. Cook, turning once, until each pita is thoroughly warmed and faint grill marks appear, 30 to 40 seconds. Remove pitas from grill and wrap tightly with aluminum foil until ready to assemble sandwiches.

PAN-ROASTED FISH FILLETS  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
Thick white fish fillets with a meaty texture, like halibut, cod, sea bass, or red snapper, work best in this recipe. Because most fish fillets differ in thickness, some pieces may finish cooking before others—be sure to immediately remove any fillet that reaches 135 degrees. You will need a 12-inch ovensafe nonstick skillet for this recipe.  
4 (6- to 8-ounce) skinless white fish fillets, 1 to 1-1⁄2 inches thick  
Salt and pepper  
1⁄2 teaspoon sugar  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
Lemon wedges or relish (recipes follow)  
Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Pat fish dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle very light dusting of sugar (about 1⁄8 teaspoon) evenly over 1 side of each fillet. Heat oil in 12-inch ovensafe nonstick skillet over high heat until just smoking. Place fillets in skillet, sugar side down, and press down lightly to ensure even contact with pan. Cook until browned, 1 to 1-1⁄2 minutes. Using 2 spatulas, flip fillets, then transfer skillet to oven. Roast fillets until centers are just opaque and register 135 degrees, 7 to 10 minutes. Immediately transfer to serving plates and serve with lemon wedges or relish spooned over each fillet.

SAUTÉED WHITE FISH FILLETS  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
When it comes to the size of a fish fillet, there are two general categories: thick and thin. Thickness determines in part how long the fillet must be cooked. Do not use fillets thinner than 1⁄4 inch, as they will overcook very quickly. These fillets are good served simply with lemon wedges, or you can prepare them with a sauce (recipes follow).  
1⁄2 cup all-purpose flour  
4 (6-ounce) boneless, skinless fish fillets, 1⁄2 to 1 inch thick, or 8 (3-ounce) boneless, skinless fish fillets, 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 inch thick  
Salt and pepper  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
Lemon wedges  
#instructions  
1. Place flour in baking dish or pie plate. Pat fish dry with paper towels. Season both sides of each fillet with salt and pepper; let stand until fillets are glistening with moisture, about 5 minutes. If using any tail-end fillets, score and tuck tail under. Coat both sides of fillets with flour, shake off excess, and place in single layer on baking sheet.  
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until shimmering. Place half of fillets in skillet in single layer and immediately reduce heat to medium-high. For thick fillets: Cook, without moving fish, until edges of fillets are opaque and bottoms are golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. For thin fillets: Cook, without moving fish, until edges of fillets are opaque and bottoms are lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.  
3. Using 2 spatulas, gently flip fillets. For thick fillets: Cook on second side until thickest part of fillets is firm to touch and fish flakes easily, 2 to 3 minutes. For thin fillets: Cook on second side until thickest part of fillets is firm to touch and fish flakes easily, 30 to 60 seconds.  
4. Transfer fillets to serving platter and tent with aluminum foil. Repeat steps 2 and 3 with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and remaining fillets.  
5. Place second batch of fillets on platter with first batch; tilt platter to discard any accumulated liquid. Serve fish immediately with lemon wedges.

FISH MEUNIÈRE WITH BROWNED BUTTER AND LEMON  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
Try to purchase fillets that are of similar size, and avoid those that weigh less than 5 ounces because they will cook too quickly. A nonstick skillet ensures that the fillets will release from the pan, but for the sauce a traditional skillet is preferable because its light-colored surface will allow you to monitor the color of the butter as it browns.  
FISH  
1⁄2 cup all-purpose flour  
4 (5- to 6-ounce) boneless, skinless sole or flounder fillets, 3⁄8 inch thick  
Salt and pepper  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 2 pieces  
BROWNED BUTTER  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces  
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley  
1-1⁄2 tablespoons lemon juice  
Salt  
Lemon wedges  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE FISH: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position, set 4 heatproof dinner plates on rack, and heat oven to 200 degrees. Place flour in baking dish or pie plate. Pat fish dry with paper towels, season both sides generously with salt and pepper, and let stand until fillets are glistening with moisture, about 5 minutes. Coat both sides of fillets with flour, shake off excess, and place in single layer on baking sheet.  
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until shimmering, then add 1 tablespoon butter and swirl to coat pan bottom. Carefully place 2 fillets, skinned side up, in skillet. Immediately reduce heat to medium-high and cook, without moving fish, until edges of fillets are opaque and bottom is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Using 2 spatulas, gently flip fillets and cook on second side until thickest part of fillet easily separates into flakes when toothpick is inserted, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer fillets, one to each heated dinner plate, keeping skinned side down, and return plates to oven. Wipe out skillet and repeat with remaining 1 tablespoon oil, remaining 1 tablespoon butter, and remaining fish fillets.  
3. FOR THE BROWNED BUTTER: Heat butter in 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until butter melts, 1 to 1-1⁄2 minutes. Continue to cook, swirling pan constantly, until butter is golden brown and has nutty aroma, 1 to 1-1⁄2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.  
4. Remove plates from oven and sprinkle fillets with parsley. Add lemon juice to browned butter and season with salt to taste. Spoon sauce over fish and serve immediately with lemon wedges.

#ingredients  
Haddock, red snapper, halibut, and sea bass also work well in this recipe as long as the fillets are 1 to 1-1⁄4 inches thick. The packets may be assembled several hours ahead of time and refrigerated until ready to cook. If the packets have been refrigerated for more than 30 minutes, increase the cooking time by 2 minutes. Open each packet promptly after baking to prevent overcooking and make sure to open packets away from you to avoid steam burns.  
2 zucchini, sliced 1⁄4 inch thick  
Salt and pepper  
2 plum tomatoes, cored, seeded, and cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces  
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
1 teaspoon minced fresh oregano  
1⁄8 teaspoon red pepper flakes  
1⁄4 cup dry vermouth or dry white wine  
4 (6-ounce) skinless cod fillets, 1 to 1-1⁄4 inches thick  
1⁄4 cup minced fresh basil  
Lemon wedges  
#instructions  
1. Toss zucchini with 1⁄2 teaspoon salt in large bowl, transfer to colander, and let sit until zucchini releases 1 to 2 tablespoons liquid, about 30 minutes. Line baking sheet with triple layer of paper towels, arrange zucchini on top, cover with another triple layer of paper towels, and firmly press each slice to remove as much liquid as possible. Meanwhile, combine tomatoes, oil, garlic, oregano, pepper flakes, 1⁄4 teaspoon salt, and 1⁄8 teaspoon pepper in medium bowl.  
2. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Cut eight 12-inch-long sheets of aluminum foil; arrange 4 pieces flat on counter. Distribute salted zucchini among arranged foil sheets, mounding vegetables in center of each piece. Pour 1 tablespoon vermouth over each mound of vegetables. Pat fish dry with paper towels, season with salt and pepper, and place 1 fillet on top of each vegetable mound. Divide tomato mixture among fillets. Place second square of foil on top of fish, crimp edges together in 1⁄2-inch fold, then fold over 3 more times to create a packet about 7 inches square. Place packets on rimmed baking sheet, overlapping slightly if necessary.  
3. Bake packets 15 minutes, then carefully open foil, allowing steam to escape away from you. Using thin metal spatula, gently slide fish and vegetables onto plate, along with any accumulated juices, and sprinkle with basil. Serve immediately, passing lemon wedges separately.  
ASSEMBLING FOIL PACKETS

FISH AND CHIPS  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
Any other similarly thick white fish, such as hake or haddock, would work here. For safety, use a Dutch oven with at least a 7-quart capacity. Any beer (even nonalcoholic beer), with the exception of dark stouts and ales, will work in this recipe. Serve with malt vinegar or tartar sauce.  
3 pounds russet potatoes, peeled, dried, sides squared off, and cut lengthwise into 1⁄2-inch-thick fries  
3 quarts plus 1⁄4 cup peanut oil or canola oil  
1-1⁄2 cups all-purpose flour  
1⁄2 cup cornstarch  
Salt  
1⁄2 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
1⁄2 teaspoon paprika  
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper  
1 teaspoon baking powder  
1-1⁄2 pounds boneless cod fillets, 1 inch thick, cut into 8 (3-ounce) pieces  
1-1⁄2 cups beer, chilled  
#instructions  
1. Place potatoes in large bowl and toss with 1⁄4 cup oil. Cover and microwave until potatoes are partially translucent and pliable but still offer some resistance when pierced with paring knife, 6 to 8 minutes, tossing halfway through cooking time. Carefully uncover, then transfer to fine-mesh strainer set in sink. Rinse potatoes well under cold running water, then spread onto kitchen towels and pat dry. Let rest until room temperature, at least 10 minutes or up to 1 hour.  
2. While potatoes cool, whisk flour, cornstarch, 2 teaspoons salt, cayenne, paprika, and pepper in large bowl. Transfer 3⁄4 cup flour mixture to rimmed baking sheet and set aside. Add baking powder to bowl with remaining flour mixture and whisk to combine.  
3. Heat 2 quarts oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until 350 degrees. Line baking sheet with triple layer of paper towels. Add fries to hot oil and increase heat to high. Fry, stirring with skimmer or slotted spoon, until potatoes turn light golden and just begin to brown at corners, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer fries to prepared baking sheet and let drain.  
4. Reduce heat to medium-high, add remaining 1 quart oil, and heat oil to 375 degrees. Line baking sheet with triple layer of paper towels. Meanwhile, thoroughly dry fish with paper towels, then dredge in flour mixture on baking sheet, shaking off excess. Transfer coated pieces to wire rack. Add 1-1⁄4 cups beer to flour mixture in mixing bowl and stir until mixture is just combined (batter will be lumpy). Add remaining beer as needed, 1 tablespoon at a time, whisking after each addition, until batter falls from whisk in thin, steady stream and leaves faint trail across surface of batter.  
5. Using tongs, dip 1 piece fish in batter and, shaking gently, let excess run off. Place battered fish back onto baking sheet with flour mixture and turn to coat both sides. Repeat with remaining fish, keeping pieces in single layer on baking sheet.  
6. When oil reaches 375 degrees, increase heat to high and, using tongs, gently shake excess flour from fish fillets and add fish to oil. Fry, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer fish to prepared baking sheet and let drain. Allow oil to return to 375 degrees.  
7. Line baking sheet with triple layer of paper towels. Add all fries back to oil and fry until golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Season fries with salt to taste and serve immediately with fish.

CRUNCHY OVEN-FRIED FISH  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
To prevent overcooking, buy fish fillets at least 1 inch thick. The bread crumbs can be made up to 3 days in advance, cooled, and stored at room temperature in an airtight container. Serve with Sweet and Tangy Tartar Sauce.  
4 hearty slices white sandwich bread, torn into quarters  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
Salt and pepper  
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley  
1 shallot, minced  
1⁄2 cup plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour  
2 large eggs  
3 tablespoons mayonnaise  
2 teaspoons prepared horseradish (optional)  
1⁄2 teaspoon paprika  
1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)  
1-1⁄4 pounds skinless cod, haddock, or other thick white fish fillets, 1 to 1-1⁄2 inches thick, cut into 4 pieces  
Lemon wedges  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Pulse bread, melted butter, 1⁄4 teaspoon salt, and 1⁄4 teaspoon pepper in food processor to coarse crumbs, about 10 pulses (you should have about 3-1⁄2 cups crumbs). Transfer to rimmed baking sheet and bake until deep golden brown and dry, about 15 minutes, stirring twice during baking time. Cool crumbs to room temperature, about 10 minutes. Transfer crumbs to pie plate and toss with parsley and shallot. Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees.  
2. Place 1⁄4 cup flour in second pie plate. In third pie plate, whisk eggs, mayonnaise, horseradish (if using), paprika, cayenne (if using), and 1⁄4 teaspoon pepper until combined. Whisk in remaining 1⁄4 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour until smooth.  
3. Spray wire rack with vegetable oil spray and place in rimmed baking sheet. Dry fish thoroughly with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Dredge 1 fillet in flour and shake off excess. Using tongs, coat fillet with egg mixture, then coat with bread-crumb mixture, pressing gently so that thick layer of crumbs adheres to fish. Transfer breaded fish to prepared wire rack. Repeat with remaining 3 fillets.  
4. Bake fish until fillets register 140 degrees, 18 to 25 minutes. Using thin spatula, transfer fillets to plates and serve immediately with lemon wedges.

BAKED SOLE FILLETS WITH HERBS AND BREAD CRUMBS  
#quantity  
SERVES 6  
#ingredients  
Try to purchase fillets of similar size. If using smaller fillets (about 3 ounces each), serve 2 fillets per person and reduce the baking time in step 3 to 20 minutes. We strongly advise against using frozen fish in this recipe. Freezing can undermine the texture of the fish, making it hard to roll. Fresh basil or dill can be used in place of the tarragon.  
3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley  
3 tablespoons minced fresh chives  
1 tablespoon minced fresh tarragon  
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest  
5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 5 pieces  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
6 (6-ounce) boneless, skinless sole or flounder fillets  
Salt and pepper  
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard  
2⁄3 cup panko bread crumbs  
Lemon wedges  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Combine parsley, chives, and tarragon in small bowl. Reserve 1 tablespoon herb mixture; stir lemon zest into remaining herb mixture.  
2. Heat 4 tablespoons butter in 8-inch skillet over medium heat until just melted. Add half of garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.  
3. Pat fillets dry with paper towels and season both sides with salt and pepper. Arrange fillets, skinned side up, with tail end pointing away from you. Spread 1⁄2 teaspoon mustard on each fillet, sprinkle each evenly with about 1 tablespoon herb–lemon zest mixture, and drizzle each with about 1-1⁄2 teaspoons garlic butter. Tightly roll fillets from thick end to form cylinders. Set fillets, seam side down, in 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Drizzle remaining garlic butter over fillets, cover baking dish with aluminum foil, and bake 25 minutes. Wipe out skillet with paper towels but do not wash.  
4. While fillets are baking, melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in now-empty skillet over medium heat. Add panko and cook, stirring frequently, until crumbs are deep golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low, add remaining garlic, and cook, stirring constantly, until garlic is fragrant and evenly distributed in crumbs, about 1 minute. Transfer to small bowl, stir in 1⁄4 teaspoon salt, and season with pepper to taste. Let cool, then stir in reserved 1 tablespoon herb mixture.  
5. After fillets have baked 25 minutes, remove baking dish from oven. Baste fillets with melted garlic butter from baking dish, sprinkle with all but 3 tablespoons bread crumbs, and continue to bake, uncovered, until fillets register 135 degrees, 6 to 10 minutes longer. Using thin metal spatula, transfer fillets to plates, sprinkle with remaining bread crumbs, and serve with lemon wedges.

SIMPLE PAN-SEARED SALMON  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
To ensure uniform pieces of fish that cook at the same rate, buy a whole center-cut fillet and cut it into 4 pieces. With the addition of the fish fillets, the pan temperature drops; compensate for the heat loss by keeping the heat on medium-high for 30 seconds after adding them. A splatter screen helps reduce the mess of pan-searing. Serve salmon with a sweet and sour chutney, a fresh salsa, an herb-spiked vinaigrette, or a squirt of lemon or lime.  
1 (1-1⁄2-pound) skin-on salmon fillet, about 1-1⁄2 inches thick  
Salt and pepper  
1 teaspoon canola oil or vegetable oil  
Lime or lemon wedges  
#instructions  
1. Use sharp knife to remove any whitish fat from belly of salmon and cut fillet into 4 equal pieces. Pat fillets dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet until shimmering, add fillets, skin side down, and cook, without moving, 30 seconds. Reduce heat to medium-high and continue to cook until skin side is well browned and bottom half of fillets turns opaque, 4-1⁄2 minutes.  
2. Turn fillets and cook second side, without moving, until fillets are no longer translucent on exterior and are firm, but not hard, when pressed, 3 minutes for medium-rare (125 degrees). Transfer fillets to serving platter and let sit 1 minute. Pat with paper towels to absorb excess fat on surface, if desired. Serve immediately with lime wedges.

SWEET AND SOUR CHUTNEY WITH ONIONS AND WARM SPICES  
#quantity  
MAKES ABOUT 1⁄3 CUP  
#ingredients  
Since it takes several minutes to make this chutney, prepare it before cooking the salmon. A little of this intensely flavored condiment goes a long way.  
1 teaspoon fennel seeds  
1⁄2 teaspoon ground cumin  
1⁄2 teaspoon ground coriander  
1⁄4 teaspoon ground cardamom  
1⁄4 teaspoon paprika  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
2 teaspoons olive oil  
1⁄2 onion, chopped fine  
1⁄4 cup red wine vinegar  
1 tablespoon sugar  
2 tablespoons water  
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley  
Mix fennel seeds, cumin, coriander, cardamom, paprika, and salt in small bowl; set aside. Heat oil in 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add reserved spice mixture and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Increase heat to medium-high and add vinegar, sugar, and water; cook until mixture reduces by about one-third and reaches syrupy consistency, about 1-1⁄2 minutes. Stir in parsley.  
PAN-SEARED BUTTERFLIED SALMON  
Butterflied salmon should look similar to a salmon steak. The advantage of this method is that both sides of the flesh get a good sear, so there is twice as much of the brown, flavorful crust. We don’t recommend it for skin lovers, because the skin never crisps since it is never exposed to the heat.  
To butterfly salmon, slice down middle of each fillet, cutting down to but not through skin. Fold halves away from each other so each side lies flat; skin should act as a hinge. Cook butterflied fillets for just 2 to 3 minutes on first side.  
PAN-SEARED SALMON WITH SESAME SEED CRUST  
For heightened sesame flavor, rub the fish fillets with toasted sesame oil instead of canola or vegetable oil. If you pair this variation with the butterflied fillets variation, double the quantity of sesame seeds and coat both sides of each fillet.  
Spread 1⁄4 cup sesame seeds in pie plate. Rub fillets with 2 teaspoons canola or vegetable oil before seasoning with salt and pepper, then press flesh sides of fillets in sesame seeds to coat. Cook fillets as directed.

GLAZED SALMON  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
To ensure uniform pieces of fish that cook at the same rate, buy a whole center-cut fillet and cut it into 4 pieces. Prepare the glaze before you cook the salmon. You will need a 12-inch ovensafe nonstick skillet for this recipe. If your nonstick skillet isn’t ovensafe, sear the salmon as directed in step 2, then transfer it to a rimmed baking sheet, glaze it, and bake as directed in step 3.  
1 teaspoon packed light brown sugar  
1⁄2 teaspoon kosher salt  
1⁄4 teaspoon cornstarch

BROILED SALMON WITH MUSTARD AND CRISP DILLED CRUST  
#quantity  
SERVES 8 TO 10  
#ingredients  
Heavy-duty aluminum foil measuring 18 inches wide is essential for creating a sling that aids in transferring the cooked fillet to a carving board. Use a large baking sheet so that the salmon will lie flat. If you can’t get the fish to lie flat, even when positioning it diagonally on the baking sheet, trim the tail end. If you prefer to cook a smaller 2-pound fillet, ask to have it cut from the thick center of the fillet, not the thin tail end, and begin checking doneness a minute earlier. We prefer thick-cut and kettle-cooked potato chips in this recipe; ridged chips would work in a pinch.  
3 slices hearty white sandwich bread, crusts removed  
4 ounces plain high-quality potato chips, crushed into rough 1⁄8-inch pieces (about 1 cup)  
6 tablespoons chopped fresh dill  
1 (3-1⁄2-pound) skin-on side of salmon, pinbones removed  
1 teaspoon olive oil  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
Pepper  
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard  
#instructions  
1. Adjust 1 oven rack to upper-middle position and other rack 3 inches from broiler element; heat oven to 400 degrees.  
2. Pulse bread in food processor to fairly even 1⁄4-inch pieces, about 10 pulses. Spread crumbs evenly on rimmed baking sheet; toast on lower rack, shaking pan once or twice, until golden brown and crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. Toss bread crumbs, crushed potato chips, and dill together in small bowl and set aside.  
3. Change oven setting to heat broiler. Use sharp knife to remove any whitish fat from belly of salmon. Cut piece of heavy-duty foil to be 6 inches longer than fillet. Fold foil lengthwise in thirds and place lengthwise on rimmed baking sheet; position salmon lengthwise on foil, allowing excess foil to overhang baking sheet. Rub fillet evenly with oil and season with salt and pepper. Broil salmon on upper rack until surface is spotty brown and outer 1⁄2 inch of thick end is opaque when gently flaked with paring knife, 9 to 11 minutes. Remove fish from oven, spread evenly with mustard, and press bread-crumb mixture onto fish. Return to lower rack and continue broiling until crust is deep golden brown, about 1 minute longer.  
4. Transfer salmon and foil sling to carving board, slide salmon off sling onto carving board and serve.  
BROILED SALMON WITH SPICY CITRUS-CILANTRO PASTE AND CRISP CRUST  
Process one 1-inch piece peeled fresh ginger, 3 garlic cloves, 3 shallots, 2 stemmed and seeded jalapeño chiles, 2 teaspoons grated lime zest plus 3 tablespoons juice (2 limes), 2 tablespoons honey, and 2 cups cilantro leaves in food processor until smooth, about 30 seconds, scraping down bowl as necessary. Omit dill and substitute 1⁄2 cup citrus-cilantro paste for Dijon mustard.  
BROILED SALMON WITH CHUTNEY AND CRISP SPICED CRUST  
Use a smooth mango chutney for this recipe. If you can find only chunky mango chutney, puree it in a food processor until smooth before using.  
Melt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter in 8-inch skillet over medium heat. Off heat, add 1 minced garlic clove, 1⁄2 teaspoon ground cumin, 1⁄2 teaspoon paprika, 1⁄4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne, and 1⁄4 teaspoon salt. Set aside. Substitute 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley for dill, toss butter-spice mixture into bread crumbs along with potato chips, and substitute 3 tablespoons smooth mango chutney for Dijon mustard.

POACHED SALMON WITH HERB AND CAPER VINAIGRETTE  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
To ensure uniform pieces of fish that cook at the same rate, buy a whole center-cut fillet and cut it into 4 pieces. If a skinless whole fillet is unavailable, remove the skin yourself or follow the recipe as directed with a skin-on fillet, adding 3 to 4 minutes to the cooking time in step 2. This recipe will yield salmon fillets cooked to medium-rare.  
2 lemons  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, stems reserved  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon, stems reserved  
1 large shallot, minced  
1⁄2 cup dry white wine  
1⁄2 cup water  
1 (1-3⁄4- to 2-pound) skinless salmon fillet, about 1-1⁄2 inches thick  
2 tablespoons capers, rinsed and chopped  
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  
1 tablespoon honey  
Salt and pepper  
#instructions  
1. Line plate with paper towels. Cut top and bottom off 1 lemon, then cut into eight to ten 1⁄4-inch-thick slices. Cut remaining lemon into 8 wedges and set aside. Arrange lemon slices in single layer across bottom of 12-inch skillet. Scatter herb stems and 2 tablespoons minced shallot evenly over lemon slices. Add wine and water to skillet.  
2. Use sharp knife to remove any whitish fat from belly of salmon and cut fillet into 4 equal pieces. Place salmon fillets in skillet, skinned side down, on top of lemon slices. Set pan over high heat and bring liquid to simmer. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until sides are opaque but center of thickest part of fillet is still translucent when cut into with paring knife, or until fillet registers 125 degrees (for medium-rare), 11 to 16 minutes. Remove pan from heat and, using spatula, carefully transfer salmon and lemon slices to prepared plate and tent loosely with aluminum foil.  
3. Return pan to high heat and simmer cooking liquid until slightly thickened and reduced to 2 tablespoons, 4 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile, combine chopped parsley and tarragon, remaining minced shallot, capers, oil, and honey in medium bowl. Strain reduced cooking liquid through fine-mesh strainer into bowl with herb mixture, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Whisk to combine and season with salt and pepper to taste.  
4. Season salmon with salt and pepper. Using spatula, carefully lift and tilt salmon fillets to remove lemon slices. Place salmon on serving platter or individual plates and spoon vinaigrette over top. Serve, passing lemon wedges separately.

OVEN-POACHED SIDE OF SALMON  
#quantity  
SERVES 8 TO 10  
#ingredients  
If serving a big crowd, you can oven-poach two individually wrapped sides of salmon in the same oven (on the upper-middle and lower-middle racks) without altering the cooking time. White wine vinegar can be substituted for the cider vinegar. The salmon is good on its own with just lemon wedges, or you can serve it with Horseradish Cream Sauce with Chives.  
1 (4-pound) skin-on side of salmon, pinbones removed  
Salt  
2 tablespoons cider vinegar  
6 sprigs fresh tarragon or dill  
2 lemons, sliced thin  
2 tablespoons minced fresh tarragon or dill

Lay sheets side by side, folded sides together; overlap edges and fold to create 1-inch seam, then press seam flat with your fingers. Lay third sheet of foil over seam and spray with vegetable oil spray.  
2. Pat salmon dry with paper towels, then season with salt. Lay salmon, skin side down, on top of foil. Sprinkle with vinegar and lay herb sprigs on top. Arrange lemon slices on top of herbs. Crimp foil down over fish.  
3. Lay foil-wrapped fish directly on baking rack (without baking sheet) and cook until flesh has turned from pink to orange and thickest part registers 135 to 140 degrees, 45 to 60 minutes.  
4. Remove fish from oven and open foil. Let salmon cool at room temperature for 30 minutes.  
5. Pour off any accumulated liquid. Reseal salmon in foil and refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour.  
6. To serve, unwrap salmon. Brush away lemon, herbs, and any solidified poaching liquid. Transfer fish to serving platter. Sprinkle salmon with minced tarragon and serve with lemon wedges.

CRISPY SALMON CAKES  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
When processing the salmon it is okay to have some pieces that are larger than 1⁄4 inch. It is important to avoid overprocessing the fish. If buying a skin-on salmon fillet, purchase 1-1⁄3 pounds of fish; this will yield 1-1⁄4 pounds of fish after skinning.  
3 tablespoons plus 3⁄4 cup panko bread crumbs  
1 scallion, sliced thin  
1 shallot, minced  
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley  
2 tablespoons mayonnaise  
4 teaspoons lemon juice  
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper  
Pinch cayenne pepper  
1 (1-1⁄4-pound) skinless salmon fillet, cut into 1-inch pieces  
1⁄2 cup vegetable oil  
Lemon wedges, 1 recipe SWEET AND TANGY TARTAR SAUCE, or 1 recipe CREAMY LEMON-HERB DIPPING SAUCE  
#instructions  
1. Line plate with paper towels and set aside. Combine 3 tablespoons panko, scallion, shallot, parsley, mayonnaise, lemon juice, mustard, salt, pepper, and cayenne in bowl. Working in 3 batches, pulse salmon in food processor until coarsely chopped into 1⁄4-inch pieces, about 2 pulses, transferring each batch to bowl with panko mixture. Gently mix until uniformly combined.  
2. Place remaining 3⁄4 cup panko in shallow baking dish or pie plate. Using 1⁄3-cup measure, scoop level amount of salmon mixture and transfer to baking sheet; repeat to make 8 cakes. Carefully coat each cake in bread crumbs, gently patting cake into disk measuring 2-3⁄4 inches in diameter and 1 inch high. Return coated cakes to baking sheet.  
3. Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Place cakes in skillet and cook, without moving, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip cakes and cook until second side is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer cakes to prepared plate to drain for 1 minute. Serve with lemon wedges or sauce.

PAN-FRIED CRAB CAKES  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
The amount of bread crumbs you add will depend on the crabmeat’s juiciness. Start with the smallest amount, and add more after adding the egg only if the cakes won’t hold together. If you can’t find fresh jumbo lump crabmeat, pasteurized crabmeat, though not as good, is a decent substitute. Either a nonstick or a traditional skillet will work for this recipe, but a nonstick simplifies cleanup.  
1 pound jumbo lump crabmeat, picked over to remove cartilage and shell fragments  
4 scallions, green parts only, minced  
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, cilantro, dill, or basil  
1⁄4 cup mayonnaise  
2–4 tablespoons plain dry bread crumbs  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning  
Salt and ground white pepper  
1 large egg, lightly beaten  
1⁄4 cup all-purpose flour  
1⁄4 cup vegetable oil  
Lemon wedges, 1 recipe SWEET AND TANGY TARTAR SAUCE, or 1 recipe CREAMY CHIPOTLE CHILE SAUCE  
#instructions  
1. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Gently mix crabmeat, scallions, parsley, mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons bread crumbs, and Old Bay in medium bowl, being careful not to break up crab lumps. Season with salt and white pepper to taste. Carefully fold in egg with rubber spatula until mixture just clings together. If cakes don’t bind, add more bread crumbs, 1 tablespoon at a time, until they do.  
2. Divide crab mixture into 4 portions and shape each portion into fat, round cake, about 3 inches in diameter and 1-1⁄2 inches thick. Arrange on prepared baking sheet, cover, and refrigerate at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours.  
3. Place flour in shallow baking dish or pie plate. Lightly dredge cakes in flour. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Gently lay floured cakes in skillet and cook until exteriors are crisp and browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Serve immediately with lemon wedges or sauce.

PAN-ROASTED HALIBUT STEAKS  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
If you plan to serve the fish with a flavored butter or sauce (recipes follow), prepare it before cooking the fish. Even well-dried fish can cause the hot oil in the pan to splatter. You can minimize splattering by laying the halibut steaks in the pan gently and putting the edge closest to you in the pan first so the far edge falls away from you.  
2 tablespoons olive oil  
2 (1-1⁄4-pound) skin-on full halibut steaks, 1-1⁄4 inches thick and 10 to 12 inches long, trimmed of cartilage  
Salt and pepper  
1 recipe flavored butter or vinaigrette (recipes follow)  
#instructions  
1. Rinse halibut steaks, dry well with paper towels, and trim cartilage from both ends. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. When oven reaches 425 degrees, heat oil in 12-inch skillet over high heat until just smoking.  
2. Meanwhile, sprinkle both sides of steaks with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium-high and swirl oil in skillet to distribute. Carefully lay steaks in skillet and cook, without moving, until spotty brown, about 4 minutes (if steaks are thinner than 1-1⁄4 inches, check browning at 3-1⁄2 minutes; steaks thicker than 1-1⁄2 inches may require extra time, so check at 4-1⁄2 minutes). Off heat, flip steaks using 2 thin-bladed metal spatulas.  
3. Transfer skillet to oven and roast until steaks register 140 degrees, flakes loosen, and flesh is opaque when checked with paring knife, about 9 minutes (thicker steaks may take up to 10 minutes). Carefully remove hot skillet from oven and separate skin and bones from fish with spatula. Transfer fish to warm platter and serve immediately dolloped with flavored butter or drizzled with vinaigrette.

CHUNKY CHERRY TOMATO–BASIL VINAIGRETTE  
#quantity  
MAKES 1-1⁄2 CUPS  
#ingredients  
Scallions can be substituted for the shallots.  
6 ounces cherry or grape tomatoes, quartered  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper  
6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  
3 tablespoons lemon juice  
2 shallots, minced  
2 tablespoons minced fresh basil  
Combine tomatoes with salt and pepper in medium bowl and let stand until juicy and seasoned, about 10 minutes. Whisk oil, lemon juice, shallots, and basil in small bowl; add to tomatoes and toss to combine.  
TRIMMING CARTILAGE FROM HALIBUT  
Cutting off the cartilage at the ends of the steaks ensures that they will fit neatly in the pan and diminishes the likelihood that the small bones located there will end up on your dinner plate.

PAN-SEARED SESAME-CRUSTED TUNA STEAKS  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
Most members of the test kitchen staff prefer their tuna steaks rare to medium-rare; the cooking times given in the recipe are for steaks cooked to these two degrees of doneness. For tuna steaks cooked medium, observe the timing for medium-rare, then tent the steaks with aluminum foil for 5 minutes before slicing. If you prefer tuna steaks cooked so rare that they are still cold in the center, try to purchase steaks that are 1-1⁄2 inches thick and cook them according to the timing below for rare steaks. Bear in mind, though, that the cooking times below are estimates; check for doneness by nicking the fish with a paring knife. Serve with Ginger-Soy Sauce with Scallions or Avocado-Orange Salsa (recipes follow), if desired.  
3⁄4 cup sesame seeds  
4 (8-ounce) tuna steaks, 1 inch thick  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
Salt and pepper  
#instructions  
1. Spread sesame seeds in shallow baking dish or pie plate. Pat tuna steaks dry with paper towels, rub steaks all over with 1 tablespoon oil, then season with salt and pepper. Press both sides of each steak in sesame seeds to coat.  
2. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until just smoking. Add tuna steaks and cook 30 seconds without moving. Reduce heat to medium-high and continue to cook until seeds are golden brown, about 1-1⁄2 minutes. Using tongs, carefully flip tuna steaks and cook, without moving, until golden brown on second side and centers register 110 degrees (for rare), about 1-1⁄2 minutes (steaks will be opaque at perimeters and translucent red at center when checked with tip of paring knife), or 125 degrees (for medium-rare), about 3 minutes (steaks will be opaque at perimeters and reddish pink at center). Cut into 1⁄4-inch-thick slices and serve.

SIMPLE SHRIMP SCAMPI  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
Use the cayenne sparingly; you are after only the faintest hint of spiciness. Serve with bread to sop up the remaining juices from both plate and skillet.  
2 tablespoons olive oil  
2 pounds extra-large shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), peeled and deveined  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter  
4 garlic cloves, minced  
2 tablespoons lemon juice  
1 tablespoon dry vermouth or dry white wine  
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley  
Pinch cayenne pepper  
Salt and pepper  
#instructions  
1. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over high heat until just smoking. Add 1 pound shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, until just opaque, about 1 minute; transfer to medium bowl. Repeat with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and remaining 1 pound shrimp, transferring shrimp to bowl with first batch.  
2. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in now-empty skillet over medium-low heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Off heat, add lemon juice and vermouth. Whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons butter, add parsley and cayenne, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Return shrimp and accumulated juices to skillet. Toss to combine; serve immediately.  
SIMPLE SHRIMP SCAMPI WITH ORANGE ZEST AND CILANTRO  
Because it is spicy, this dish is best served with white rice.  
Add 1 teaspoon grated orange zest and 1⁄4 teaspoon red pepper flakes to skillet with garlic in step 2. Omit cayenne and substitute 2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro for parsley.  
SIMPLE SHRIMP SCAMPI WITH CUMIN, PAPRIKA, AND SHERRY VINEGAR  
This variation is deeply flavorful but has slightly less heat than either of the other two versions.  
Add 2 teaspoons paprika and 1 teaspoon ground cumin to skillet with garlic in step 2. Omit cayenne and substitute 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar for lemon juice.  
DEVEINING SHRIMP  
Deveining usually creates a large, unsightly slit on the outer curve of shrimp. Try this technique for more attractive results.  
#instructions  
1. Insert one tine of a dinner fork into the shrimp, pass the tine beneath the vein, and hook it under.  
2. Draw the vein out through the very small hole you’ve created, leaving the shrimp looking virtually untouched.

GARLICKY SHRIMP WITH BUTTERED BREAD CRUMBS  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
Vermouth can be substituted for the sherry. If using vermouth, increase the amount to 1⁄2 cup and reduce the amount of clam juice to 1⁄2 cup. To prepare this recipe in a 10-inch skillet, brown the shrimp in three batches for about 2 minutes each, using 2 teaspoons oil per batch. Serve the shrimp with rice and either broccoli or asparagus.  
1 (3-inch) piece baguette, cut into small pieces  
5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 5 pieces  
1 small shallot, minced  
Salt and pepper  
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley  
2 pounds extra-large shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), peeled and deveined  
1⁄4 teaspoon sugar  
4 teaspoons vegetable oil  
4 garlic cloves, minced  
1⁄8 teaspoon red pepper flakes  
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour  
2⁄3 cup bottled clam juice  
1⁄3 cup dry sherry  
2 teaspoons lemon juice plus lemon wedges  
#instructions  
1. Pulse bread in food processor until coarsely ground, about 8 pulses. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add crumbs, shallot, 1⁄8 teaspoon salt, and 1⁄8 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon parsley and transfer to plate to cool. Wipe out skillet with paper towels.  
2. Pat shrimp dry with paper towels. Toss shrimp with sugar, 1⁄4 teaspoon salt, and 1⁄4 teaspoon pepper in bowl. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in now-empty skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add half of shrimp in single layer and cook until spotty brown and edges turn pink, about 3 minutes (do not flip shrimp). Remove pan from heat and transfer shrimp to large plate. Wipe out skillet with paper towels. Repeat with remaining 2 teaspoons oil and remaining 1 pound shrimp; transfer shrimp to plate with first batch.  
3. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in now-empty skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and pepper flakes and cook, stirring frequently, until garlic just begins to color, about 1 minute. Add flour and cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute. Increase heat to medium-high and slowly whisk in clam juice and sherry. Bring to simmer and cook until mixture reduces to 3⁄4 cup, 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk in remaining 3 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Stir in lemon juice and remaining tablespoon parsley.  
4. Reduce heat to medium-low, return shrimp to skillet with sauce, and toss to combine. Cook, covered, until shrimp are pink and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Uncover and sprinkle with toasted bread crumbs. Serve with lemon wedges.

GREEK-STYLE SHRIMP WITH TOMATOES AND FETA  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
This recipe works equally well with either jumbo shrimp (16 to 20 per pound) or extra-large shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), but the cooking times in step 3 will vary slightly depending on which you use. If you don’t have ouzo, you can substitute an equal amount of Pernod or 1 tablespoon vodka plus 1⁄8 teaspoon anise seeds. Serve the shrimp with crusty bread or steamed white rice.  
1-1⁄2 pounds shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails left on if desired  
1⁄4 cup extra-virgin olive oil  
3 tablespoons ouzo  
5 garlic cloves, minced  
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest  
Salt and pepper  
1 small onion, chopped  
1⁄2 red bell pepper, chopped  
1⁄2 green bell pepper, chopped  
1⁄2 teaspoon red pepper flakes  
1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained with 1⁄3 cup juice reserved  
1⁄4 cup dry white wine  
2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh parsley  
6 ounces feta cheese, crumbled (1-1⁄2 cups)  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill  
#instructions  
1. Toss shrimp, 1 tablespoon oil, 1 tablespoon ouzo, 1 teaspoon garlic, lemon zest, 1⁄4 teaspoon salt, and 1⁄8 teaspoon pepper in small bowl until well combined. Set aside while preparing sauce.  
2. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, and 1⁄4 teaspoon salt and stir to combine. Cover skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables release their moisture, 3 to 5 minutes. Uncover and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until moisture cooks off and vegetables have softened, about 5 minutes longer. Add remaining garlic and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes and reserved juice, wine, and remaining 2 tablespoons ouzo, increase heat to medium-high, and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors have melded and sauce is slightly thickened (sauce should not be completely dry), 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste.  
3. Reduce heat to medium-low and add shrimp along with any accumulated juices to pan; stir to coat and distribute evenly. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are opaque throughout, 6 to 9 minutes for extra-large or 7 to 11 minutes for jumbo, adjusting heat as needed to maintain bare simmer. Remove pan from heat and sprinkle with feta. Drizzle remaining tablespoon oil over top and sprinkle with dill. Serve immediately.

PAELLA  
#quantity  
SERVES 6  
#ingredients  
This recipe is for making paella in a Dutch oven (the Dutch oven should be 11 to 12 inches in diameter with at least a 6-quart capacity). With minor modifications, it can also be made in a paella pan . Dry-cured Spanish chorizo is the sausage of choice for paella, but fresh chorizo or linguiça is an acceptable substitute. Socarrat, a layer of crusty browned rice that forms on the bottom of the pan, is a traditional part of paella. In our version, socarrat does not develop because most of the cooking is done in the oven. We have provided instructions to develop socarrat in step 5; if you prefer, skip this step and go directly from step 4 to 6. To debeard the mussels, simply pull off the weedy black fibers.  
1 pound extra-large shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), peeled and deveined  
Salt and pepper  
2 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra as needed  
8 garlic cloves, minced  
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and halved crosswise  
1 red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and cut into 1⁄2-inch-wide strips  
8 ounces Spanish chorizo sausage, sliced 1⁄2 inch thick on bias  
1 onion, chopped fine  
1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained, minced, and drained again  
2 cups Valencia or Arborio rice  
3 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
1⁄3 cup dry white wine  
1⁄2 teaspoon saffron threads, crumbled  
1 bay leaf  
12 mussels, scrubbed and debearded  
1⁄2 cup frozen peas, thawed  
2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley  
Lemon wedges  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Toss shrimp, 1⁄4 teaspoon salt, 1⁄4 teaspoon pepper, 1 tablespoon oil, and 1 teaspoon garlic in medium bowl. Cover and refrigerate until needed. Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper and set aside.  
2. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add bell pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until skin begins to blister and turn spotty black, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer bell pepper to small plate and set aside.  
3. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in now-empty pot until shimmering. Add chicken pieces in single layer and cook, without moving, until browned, about 3 minutes. Turn pieces and cook until browned on second side, about 3 minutes. Transfer chicken to medium bowl. Reduce heat to medium and add chorizo to pot. Cook, stirring frequently, until deeply browned and fat begins to render, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer chorizo to bowl with chicken and set aside.  
4. Add enough oil to fat in pot to equal 2 tablespoons and heat over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in remaining garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes and cook until mixture begins to darken and thicken slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir in rice and cook until grains are well coated with tomato mixture, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in chicken broth, wine, saffron, bay leaf, and 1⁄2 teaspoon salt. Return chicken and chorizo to pot, increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil, stirring occasionally. Cover pot, transfer to oven, and cook until rice absorbs almost all liquid, about 15 minutes. Remove pot from oven. Uncover pot, scatter shrimp over rice, insert mussels, hinged side down, into rice (so they stand upright), arrange bell pepper strips in pinwheel pattern, and scatter peas over top. Cover, return to oven, and cook until shrimp are opaque and mussels have opened, 10 to 12 minutes.  
5. FOR SOCARRAT: If socarrat is desired, set pot, uncovered, over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, rotating pot 180 degrees after about 2 minutes for even browning.  
6. Let paella stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Discard any mussels that have not opened and bay leaf, if it can be easily removed. Sprinkle with parsley and serve, passing lemon wedges separately.  
PAELLA IN A PAELLA PAN  
A paella pan makes for an attractive and impressive presentation. Use one that is 14 to 15 inches in diameter; the ingredients will not fit in a smaller pan.  
Increase chicken broth to 3-1⁄4 cups and wine to 1⁄2 cup. Before placing pan in oven, cover it tightly with aluminum foil. For socarrat, cook paella, uncovered, over medium-high heat for about 3 minutes, rotating pan 180 degrees after about 1-1⁄2 minutes for even browning.

While we prefer hard-shell lobsters to soft-shell lobsters, soft-shell lobsters are more available in the summer (late spring and early summer is the best time to find hard-shell lobsters). However, because hard-shell lobsters are more packed with meat than soft-shell ones, you may want to buy 1-1⁄2- to 1-3⁄4-pound soft-shell lobsters per person.  
4 live lobsters  
8 tablespoons butter, melted (optional)  
Lemon wedges  
Fit stockpot or Dutch oven with steamer basket or pasta insert. Add water, keeping level below basket. Bring water to boil. Add lobsters, cover, and return water to boil.

For maximum crispness, cook the crabs in two pans, each covered with a splatter screen, so that you can serve the crabs as soon as they are cooked. If you are working with just one splatter screen and pan, cook 4 crabs in 4 tablespoons butter, transfer to a platter in a 300-degree oven, wipe out the pan, and repeat with the remaining crabs. The pan sauce is powerfully flavored; you only need about 1 tablespoon per serving.  
1 cup all-purpose flour  
8 (medium to large) soft-shell crabs  
10 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1 teaspoon lemon juice  
1 teaspoon sherry vinegar  
1-1⁄2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley  
1 scallion, minced  
1 teaspoon minced fresh tarragon  
1 teaspoon capers, rinsed and minced

Add 1 teaspoon salt to remaining marinade. Place marinade and chicken in 1-gallon zipper-lock bag and toss to coat; press out as much air as possible and seal bag. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes, flipping bag halfway through marinating. Brush both sides of onion rounds and peppers with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.  
2A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour coals over two-thirds of grill, leaving remaining one-third empty. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.  
2B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and turn other burner(s) to medium.  
3. Clean and oil cooking grate. Remove chicken from bag, allowing excess marinade to drip off. Place chicken on hotter side of grill, smooth side down. Cook (covered if using gas) until well browned on first side, 4 to 6 minutes. Flip and continue to cook until chicken registers 160 degrees, 4 to 6 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to carving board, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.  
4. While chicken cooks, place onion rounds and peppers (skin side down) on cooler side of grill and cook until tender and charred on both sides, 8 to 12 minutes, flipping every 3 minutes. Transfer onions and peppers to carving board with chicken.  
5. Working in 2 or 3 batches, place tortillas in single layer on cooler side of grill. Cook until warm and lightly browned, about 20 seconds per side (do not grill too long or tortillas will become brittle). As tortillas are done, wrap in kitchen towel or large sheet of aluminum foil.  
6. Separate onions into rings and place in medium bowl. Slice peppers into 1⁄4-inch strips and place in bowl with onions. Add 2 tablespoons reserved marinade and toss to combine. Slice each breast on bias into 1⁄4-inch-thick slices, place in second bowl, and toss with remaining 2 tablespoons reserved marinade.  
7. Transfer chicken and vegetables to serving platter and serve with warmed tortillas.

INDOOR CHICKEN FAJITAS  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
You can use red, yellow, orange, or green bell peppers in this recipe. The chicken tenderloins can be reserved for another use or marinated and cooked along with the breasts. The chicken and vegetables have enough flavor on their own, but accompaniments (guacamole, salsa, sour cream, shredded cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese, and lime wedges) can be offered at the table.  
6 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons vegetable oil  
1⁄3 cup lime juice (3 limes)  
1 jalapeño chile, stemmed, seeded, and minced  
4-1⁄2 teaspoons minced fresh cilantro  
3 garlic cloves, minced  
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons brown sugar  
Salt and pepper  
1-1⁄2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, tenderloins removed, trimmed, pounded to 1⁄2-inch thickness  
1 large red onion, peeled and cut into 1⁄2-inch-thick rounds (do not separate rings)  
2 large bell peppers, quartered, stemmed, and seeded  
8–12 (6-inch) flour tortillas  
#instructions  
1. Whisk 1⁄4 cup oil, lime juice, jalapeño, cilantro, garlic, Worcestershire, sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, and 3⁄4 teaspoon pepper together in bowl. Reserve 1⁄4 cup marinade and set aside. Add 1 teaspoon salt to remaining marinade. Place marinade and chicken in 1-gallon zipper-lock bag and toss to coat; press out as much air as possible and seal bag. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes, flipping bag halfway through marinating. Brush both sides of onion rounds and peppers with 2 tablespoons oil and season with salt and pepper.  
2. Adjust 1 oven rack to upper middle position and second rack to lower-middle position and heat broiler.  
3. Arrange onion rounds and peppers (skin sides up) in single layer on rimmed baking sheet. Wrap tortillas securely in aluminum foil in 2 packets, each containing half of tortillas.  
4. Remove chicken from marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place chicken in pan, smooth side down, and cook until well browned on both sides, 5 to 7 minutes, flipping halfway through cooking. Reduce heat to medium and continue to cook until chicken registers 160 degrees, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to carving board, tent loosely with foil, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.  
5. While chicken is cooking, place baking sheet with vegetables in oven on upper rack and place tortilla packets on lower rack. Broil vegetables until spottily charred and peppers are crisp-tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Using tongs, transfer peppers to carving board. Flip onion rounds and continue to broil until charred and tender, 2 to 4 minutes longer. Turn off broiler and remove vegetables, leaving tortillas in oven until needed.  
6. Separate onions into rings and place in medium bowl. Slice peppers into 1⁄4-inch strips and place in bowl with onions. Add 2 tablespoons reserved marinade and toss to combine. Slice each breast on bias into 1⁄4-inch-thick slices, place in second bowl, and toss with remaining 2 tablespoons marinade.  
7. Transfer chicken and vegetables to serving platter and serve with warmed tortillas.  
PREVENTING PROPANE TANK PANIC  
There’s nothing worse than running out of fuel halfway through grilling. If your grill doesn’t have a gas gauge, use this technique to estimate how much gas is left in the tank.  
#instructions  
1. Bring 1 cup water to boil. Pour water over side of tank.  
2. Feel metal with your hand. Where water has succeeded in warming tank, it is empty; where tank remains cool to touch, there is still propane inside.

BARBECUED CHICKEN KEBABS  
#quantity  
SERVES 6  
#ingredients  
Use the large holes of a box grater to grate the onion for the sauce. We prefer flavorful dark thigh meat for these kebabs, but white meat can be used. Whichever you choose, don’t mix white and dark meat on the same skewer, since they cook at different rates. If you have thin pieces of chicken, cut them larger than 1 inch and roll or fold them into approximate 1-inch cubes. Turbinado sugar is commonly sold as Sugar in the Raw. Demerara sugar can be substituted. You will need four 12-inch metal skewers for this recipe.  
SAUCE  
1⁄2 cup ketchup  
1⁄4 cup molasses  
2 tablespoons grated onion  
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce  
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard  
2 tablespoons cider vinegar  
1 tablespoon packed light brown sugar  
CHICKEN  
2 tablespoons sweet paprika  
4 teaspoons turbinado sugar  
2 teaspoons kosher salt  
2 teaspoons smoked paprika  
2 slices bacon, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces  
2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts, trimmed, cut into 1-inch chunks  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE SAUCE: Bring all ingredients to simmer in small saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 1 cup, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer 1⁄2 cup sauce to small bowl and set remaining sauce aside for serving.  
2. FOR THE CHICKEN: Combine sweet paprika, sugar, salt, and smoked paprika in large bowl. Process bacon in food processor until smooth paste forms, 30 to 45 seconds, scraping down bowl as needed. Add bacon paste and chicken to spice mixture and mix with hands or rubber spatula until ingredients are thoroughly blended and chicken is completely coated. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. Thread chicken tightly onto four 12-inch metal skewers.  
3A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter three-quarters filled with charcoal briquettes (4-1⁄2 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.  
3B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Turn all burners to medium-high.  
4. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place skewers on hot part of grill (if using charcoal), and cook (covered if using gas), turning kebabs every 2 to 2-1⁄2 minutes, until well browned and slightly charred, 8 to 10 minutes. Brush top surface of skewers with 1⁄4 cup sauce, flip, and cook until sauce is sizzling and browning in spots, about 1 minute. Brush second side with remaining 1⁄4 cup sauce, flip, and continue to cook until sizzling and browning in spots, about 1 minute longer.  
5. Transfer skewers to serving platter, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Serve, passing reserved sauce separately.

SAUCE  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
1 onion, chopped fine  
Salt and pepper

APPLE-MUSTARD GRILLING SAUCE  
#quantity  
MAKES ABOUT 1 CUP  
#ingredients  
Our grilling sauces work equally well on chicken or pork and yield enough to coat 6 to 8 pieces (3 to 4 pounds) of meat, plus extra for the table. Wait to apply until the last 5 minutes of grilling (the meat should be about 5 degrees below the desired final internal temperature). Brush one side of the meat with 1⁄4 cup of the sauce reserved for cooking, then flip it and cook until browned, about 2 minutes. Brush the second side with another 1⁄4 cup of sauce reserved for cooking, then flip it and cook until browned on the second side, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve, passing the remaining 1⁄2 cup sauce separately. We prefer to make this sauce in a heavy-bottomed saucepan because its insulation protects against scorching.  
2⁄3 cup apple cider or apple juice  
1⁄3 cup apple butter  
3 tablespoons whole grain mustard  
1 teaspoon dry mustard  
2 tablespoons cider vinegar  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
1⁄3 cup water  
1⁄3 cup sugar  
#instructions  
1. Whisk cider, apple butter, whole grain and dry mustards, vinegar, salt, and cayenne in medium bowl.  
2. Place water in 2-quart saucepan; pour sugar in center of pan, taking care not to let sugar crystals adhere to sides of pan. Cover and bring mixture to boil over high heat; once boiling, uncover and continue to boil until syrup is thick and straw-colored, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and continue to cook until syrup is golden amber, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Quickly remove saucepan from heat and whisk in cider mixture. Return to medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until caramel has dissolved and sauce has thickened, about 2 minutes. Transfer 1⁄2 cup sauce to medium bowl to use for grilling. Set aside remaining sauce for serving.  
HOISIN GRILLING SAUCE  
Whisk 1⁄2 cup hoisin sauce, 3 tablespoons rice vinegar, 3 tablespoons pineapple juice, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger, 1⁄4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, and pinch five-spice powder in medium bowl and substitute for cider mixture in step 2.  
ORANGE-CHIPOTLE GRILLING SAUCE  
Whisk 1⁄2 cup orange marmalade, 1⁄2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest, 1⁄3 cup orange juice, 1⁄4 cup white vinegar, 1 tablespoon minced canned chipotle chile in adobo sauce, and 1⁄2 teaspoon salt in medium bowl and substitute for cider mixture in step 2.  
COCONUT–RED CURRY GRILLING SAUCE  
Whisk 1-1⁄4 cups coconut milk, 1⁄2 teaspoon finely grated lime zest and 1⁄4 cup lime juice (2 limes), 1 tablespoon red curry paste, and 1 tablespoon fish sauce in medium bowl and substitute for cider mixture in step 2, increasing final sauce thickening time to 6 to 7 minutes.

GRILLED STUFFED CHICKEN BREASTS WITH PROSCIUTTO AND FONTINA  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
If using kosher chicken, do not brine in step 1. You can serve the chicken on the bone, but we prefer to carve it off and slice it before serving.  
4 (10- to 12-ounce) bone-in split chicken breasts, trimmed  
Salt and pepper  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened  
1 shallot, minced  
4 teaspoons chopped fresh tarragon  
2 ounces fontina cheese, rind removed, cut into four 3 by 1⁄2-inch sticks  
4 thin slices prosciutto  
#instructions  
1. Using sharp knife and starting on thick side of breast closest to breastbone, cut horizontal pocket in each breast, stopping 1⁄2 inch from edge so halves remain attached. Dissolve 1⁄4 cup salt in 2 quarts cold water in large container. Submerge chicken breasts in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Remove chicken from brine and pat dry with paper towels. Season chicken with pepper.

Chicken leg quarters consist of drumsticks attached to thighs; often also attached are backbone sections that must be trimmed away. Brining improves the chicken’s flavor, but if you’re short on time, you can skip step 1 and simply flavor the chicken .  
1⁄2 cup sugar  
1⁄2 cup salt  
4 (14-ounce) chicken leg quarters or 8 (5- to 7 -ounce) bone-in chicken thighs, trimmed  
Pepper  
#instructions  
1. Dissolve sugar and salt in 2 quarts cold water in large container. Submerge chicken leg quarters in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Remove chicken from brine and pat dry with paper towels. Season chicken with pepper.  
2A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour two-thirds evenly over grill, then pour remaining coals over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.  
2B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Turn all burners to medium-high.  
3. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place chicken on grill (hotter side if using charcoal), skin side down. Cook (covered if using gas) until well browned on both sides, 4 to 6 minutes, flipping halfway through cooking. Move chicken to cooler side of grill (if using charcoal) or turn burners to medium-low (if using gas). Cover and continue to cook, turning occasionally, until chicken is dark and registers 175 degrees, 16 to 20 minutes for whole legs and 12 to 16 minutes for thighs.

BARBECUED PULLED CHICKEN  
#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
Chicken leg quarters consist of drumsticks attached to thighs; often also attached are backbone sections that must be trimmed away. Two medium wood chunks, soaked in water for 1 hour, can be substituted for the wood chip packet on a charcoal grill. Serve the pulled chicken on hamburger rolls or sandwich bread, with pickles and coleslaw.  
CHICKEN  
2 cups wood chips, soaked in water for 15 minutes and drained  
1 (16 by 12-inch) disposable aluminum roasting pan (if using charcoal)  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
8 (14-ounce) chicken leg quarters, trimmed  
Salt and pepper  
SAUCE  
1 large onion, peeled and quartered  
1⁄4 cup water  
1-1⁄2 cups ketchup  
1-1⁄2 cups apple cider  
1⁄4 cup molasses  
1⁄4 cup apple cider vinegar  
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce  
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard  
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
1-1⁄2 tablespoons chili powder  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
1⁄2 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
Hot sauce  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CHICKEN: Using large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, wrap soaked chips in foil packet and cut several vent holes in top.  
2A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent halfway and place roasting pan in center of grill. Light large chimney starter three-quarters filled with charcoal briquettes (4-1⁄2 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour into 2 even piles on either side of roasting pan. Place wood chip packet on 1 pile of coals. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent halfway. Heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 5 minutes.  
2B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Place wood chip packet directly on primary burner. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 15 minutes. Turn all burners to medium. (Adjust burners as needed during cooking to maintain grill temperature between 250 and 300 degrees.)  
3. Clean and oil cooking grate. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Place chicken in single layer on center of grill (over roasting pan if using charcoal), skin side up, or evenly over grill (if using gas). Cover (position lid vent over meat if using charcoal) and cook until chicken registers 185 degrees, 1 to 1-1⁄2 hours, rotating the chicken pieces halfway through cooking. Transfer chicken to carving board, tent loosely with foil, and let rest until cool enough to handle.  
4. FOR THE SAUCE: Meanwhile, process onion and water in food processor until mixture resembles slush, about 30 seconds. Pass through fine-mesh strainer into liquid measuring cup, pressing on solids with rubber spatula (you should have 3⁄4 cup strained onion juice). Discard solids in strainer.  
5. Whisk onion juice, ketchup, cider, molasses, 3 tablespoons vinegar, Worcestershire, mustard, and 1⁄2 teaspoon pepper together in bowl. Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Stir in chili powder, garlic, and cayenne and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in ketchup mixture, bring to simmer, and cook over medium-low heat until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes (you should have about 4 cups of sauce). Transfer 2 cups sauce to serving bowl; leave remaining sauce in saucepan.  
6. TO SERVE: Remove and discard skin from chicken legs. Using your fingers, pull meat off bones, separating larger pieces (which should fall off bones easily) from smaller, drier pieces into 2 equal piles.  
7. Pulse smaller chicken pieces in food processor until just coarsely chopped, 3 to 4 pulses, stirring chicken with rubber spatula after each pulse. Add chopped chicken to sauce in saucepan. Using your fingers or 2 forks, pull larger chicken pieces into long shreds and add to saucepan. Stir in remaining 1 tablespoon cider vinegar, cover, and heat chicken over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 10 minutes. Add hot sauce to taste and serve, passing remaining sauce separately.  
BARBECUED PULLED CHICKEN FOR A CROWD  
This recipe serves 10 to 12. This technique works well on a charcoal grill but not so well on a gas grill. If your gas grill is large and can accommodate more than 8 legs, follow the master recipe, adding as many legs as will comfortably fit in a single layer.  
Increase amount of charcoal briquettes to 6 quarts. Use 12 chicken legs and slot them into V-shaped roasting rack set on top of cooking grate over disposable aluminum pan. Increase cooking time in step 3 to 1-1⁄2 to 1-3⁄4 hours. In step 5, remove only 1 cup of sauce from saucepan. In step 7, pulse chicken in food processor in 2 batches.  
IMPROVISED GRILL BRUSH  
Food that is being grilled is much less likely to stick to a clean grate. We recommend cleaning the hot grate with a grill brush. But if you don’t have one handy, a brush can be improvised with a pair of tongs and a crumpled wad of aluminum foil.

ITALIAN-STYLE GRILLED CHICKEN  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
Use an oven mitt or kitchen towel to safely grip and maneuver the hot bricks. You will need two standard-size bricks for this recipe. Placing the bricks on the chicken while it cooks ensures that the skin will be evenly browned and well rendered. A cast-iron skillet or other heavy pan can be used in place of the bricks.  
1⁄3 cup extra-virgin olive oil  
8 garlic cloves, minced  
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest plus 2 tablespoons juice  
Pinch red pepper flakes  
4 teaspoons minced fresh thyme  
1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary  
Salt and pepper  
1 (3-1⁄2- to 4-pound) whole chicken  
#instructions  
1. Heat oil, garlic, lemon zest, and pepper flakes in small saucepan over medium-low heat until sizzling, about 3 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon thyme and 2 teaspoons rosemary and continue to cook for 30 seconds longer. Strain mixture through fine-mesh strainer set over small bowl, pushing on solids to extract oil. Transfer solids to bowl and cool; set oil and solids aside.  
2. TO BUTTERFLY CHICKEN: Use kitchen shears to cut along both sides of backbone to remove it. Flatten breastbone and tuck wings behind back. Use hands or handle of wooden spoon to loosen skin over breast and thighs and remove any excess fat.  
3. Combine 1-1⁄2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper in bowl. Mix 2 teaspoons salt mixture with cooled garlic solids. Spread salt-garlic mixture evenly under skin over chicken breast and thighs. Sprinkle remaining 1⁄2 teaspoon salt mixture on exposed meat of bone side. Place chicken skin side up on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.  
4A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent halfway. Light large chimney starter three-quarters filled with charcoal briquettes (4-1⁄2 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, wrap 2 bricks tightly in aluminum foil, and place on cooking grate. Cover and open lid vent halfway. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.  
4B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Wrap 2 bricks tightly in aluminum foil and place on cooking grate Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and turn off other burner(s). (Adjust primary burner as needed during cooking to maintain grill temperature around 350 degrees.)  
5. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place chicken on cooler side of grill, skin side down, with legs facing coals and flames. Place hot bricks lengthwise over each breast half, cover, and cook until skin is lightly browned and faint grill marks appear, 22 to 25 minutes. Remove bricks from chicken. Using tongs, grip legs and flip chicken (chicken should release freely from grill; use thin metal spatula to loosen if stuck), then transfer to hot side of grill, skin side up. Place bricks over breast, cover, and cook until chicken is well browned, 12 to 15 minutes.  
6. Remove bricks, flip chicken skin side down, and continue to cook until skin is well browned and breast registers 160 degrees and thighs register 175 degrees, 5 to 10 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to carving board, tent loosely with foil, and let rest for 15 minutes.

GRILL-ROASTED TURKEY  
#quantity  
SERVES 10 TO 12  
#ingredients  
If using a self-basting turkey or kosher turkey, do not brine in step 1, and season with salt after brushing with melted butter in step 2. When using a charcoal grill, we prefer wood chunks to wood chips whenever possible; substitute 6 medium wood chunks, soaked in water for 1 hour, for the wood chip packets. The total cooking time is 2 to 2-1⁄2 hours, depending on the size of the bird, the ambient conditions (the bird will require more time on a cool, windy day), and the intensity of the fire.  
1 cup salt  
1 (12- to 14-pound) turkey, trimmed, neck, giblets, and tailpiece removed, and wings tucked behind back  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
6 cups wood chips, soaked in water for 15 minutes and drained  
#instructions  
1. Dissolve salt in 2 gallons cold water in large container. Submerge turkey in brine, cover, and refrigerate or store in very cool spot (40 degrees or less) for 6 to 12 hours.  
2. Lightly spray V-rack with vegetable oil spray. Remove turkey from brine and pat dry, inside and out, with paper towels. Brush both sides of turkey with melted butter and place breast side down in prepared V-rack.  
3. Using 3 large pieces of heavy-duty aluminum foil, wrap soaked chips in 3 foil packets and cut several vent holes in top.  
4A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent halfway. Light large chimney mounded with charcoal briquettes (7 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour into steeply banked pile against side of grill. Place 1 wood chip packet on pile of coals. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent halfway. Heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 5 minutes.  
4B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Place 1 wood chip packet directly on primary burner. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 15 minutes. Turn primary burner to medium-high and turn off other burner(s). (Adjust primary burner as needed during cooking to maintain grill temperature around 325 degrees.)  
5. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place V-rack with turkey on cool side of grill with leg and wing facing coal, cover (position lid vent over turkey if using charcoal), and cook for 1 hour.  
6. Using potholders, transfer V-rack with turkey to rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan. If using charcoal, remove cooking grate and add 12 new briquettes and second wood chip packet to pile of coals; set cooking grate in place. If using gas, place remaining wood chip packets directly on primary burner. With wad of paper towels in each hand, flip turkey breast side up in rack and return V-rack with turkey to cool side of grill, with other leg and wing facing heat. Cover (position lid vent over turkey if using charcoal) and cook for 45 minutes.  
7. Using potholders, carefully rotate V-rack with turkey (breast remains up) 180 degrees. Cover and continue to cook until breast registers 160 degrees and thighs register 175 degrees, 15 to 45 minutes longer. Transfer turkey to carving board, tent loosely with foil, and let rest for 20 to 30 minutes. Carve and serve.

GREAT GRILLED TURKEY BURGERS  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  

1 (2-pound) bone-in turkey thigh, skinned and boned, cut into 1-inch chunks  
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce  
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
4 hamburger rolls, toasted  
#instructions  
1. Arrange turkey chunks on baking sheet and freeze until semifirm, about 30 minutes.  
2. Working in 3 batches, pulse semi-frozen turkey chunks in food processor until largest pieces are no bigger than 1⁄8 inch, 12 to 14 pulses. Transfer ground turkey to bowl and stir in Worcestershire, mustard, salt, and pepper. Divide meat into 4 portions and lightly toss 1 portion from hand to hand to form ball, then lightly flatten ball with fingertips into 1-inch-thick patty. Press center of patty down with fingertips until it is about 1⁄2 inch thick, creating a slight depression. Repeat with remaining portions.  
3A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter three-quarters filled with charcoal briquettes (4-1⁄2 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour two-thirds evenly over grill, then pour remaining coals over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.  
3B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes.  
4. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place burgers on grill (hot side if using charcoal) and cook, without pressing on them, until well browned on both sides, 5 to 7 minutes, flipping halfway through cooking.  
5. Move burgers to cooler side of grill (if using charcoal), or turn all burners to medium (if using gas). Cover and continue to cook until burgers are cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes longer, flipping halfway through cooking.  
6. Transfer burgers to serving platter, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving on rolls.  
QUICKER TURKEY BURGERS  
This recipe will enrich store-bought ground lean turkey so that it makes excellent burgers. Ricotta cheese can burn easily, so keep a close watch on the burgers as they cook.  
Substitute 1-1⁄4 pounds 93 percent lean ground turkey for turkey thighs and add 1⁄2 cup whole-milk ricotta cheese to turkey with seasonings.  
MISO TURKEY BURGERS  
Japanese miso, a paste made from fermenting rice, barley, or soybeans, gives the turkey burgers a particularly savory, beefy flavor.  
Stir 2 teaspoons white miso together with 2 teaspoons water. Omit Worcestershire sauce and mustard and add miso mixture with seasonings.  
INDOOR TURKEY BURGERS  
Pan-frying develops an especially nice crust on the burgers when grilling isn’t an option.  
Heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil in 12-inch skillet over medium heat until just smoking. Add burgers to pan and cook over medium heat without moving burgers until bottom side of each is dark brown and crusted, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip burgers and continue to cook until bottom side is light brown but not yet crusted, 3 to 4 minutes longer. Reduce heat to low, position skillet lid slightly ajar on pan to allow steam to escape, and continue to cook 8 to 10 minutes longer, flipping burgers if necessary to promote deep browning, until burgers register 160 degrees. Serve immediately.

GRILLED HAMBURGERS  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
Weighing the meat on a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to portion it. If you don’t own a scale, do your best to divide the meat evenly into quarters. Eighty percent lean ground chuck is our favorite for flavor, but 85 percent lean works, too.  
1-1⁄2 pounds 80 percent lean ground chuck  
1 teaspoon salt  
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper  
4 hamburger rolls, toasted  
#instructions  
1. Using hands, gently break up meat, season with salt and pepper, and toss lightly to incorporate. Divide meat into 4 portions and lightly toss 1 portion from hand to hand to form ball, then lightly flatten ball with fingertips into 3⁄4-inch-thick patty. Press center of patty down with fingertips until it is about 1⁄2 inch thick, creating slight depression. Repeat with remaining portions.  
2A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.  
2B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes.  
3. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place burgers on grill and cook, without pressing on them, until well browned on first side, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip burgers and continue to grill, 2 to 3 minutes for rare, 2-1⁄2 to 3-1⁄2 minutes for medium-rare, and 3 to 4 minutes for medium.  
4. Transfer burgers to serving platter, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving on rolls.  
GRILLED CHEESEBURGERS  
Since the cheese is evenly distributed in these burgers, just a little goes a long way.  
Mix 3⁄4 cup shredded cheddar, Swiss, or Monterey Jack cheese or 3⁄4 cup crumbled blue cheese into meat with salt and pepper.  
GRILLED HAMBURGERS WITH GARLIC, CHIPOTLES, AND SCALLIONS  
Toast 3 unpeeled garlic cloves in small skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 8 minutes. When cool enough to handle, peel and mince. Mix garlic, 2 tablespoons minced scallion, and 1 tablespoon minced chipotle chile in adobo sauce into meat with salt and pepper.  
GRILLED HAMBURGERS WITH PORCINI MUSHROOMS AND THYME  
Mix 1⁄2 ounce dried porcini mushrooms, rinsed and minced, and 1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme into meat with salt and pepper.  
GRILLED HAMBURGERS WITH COGNAC, MUSTARD, AND CHIVES  
Mix 1-1⁄2 tablespoons cognac, 1 tablespoon minced fresh chives, and 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard in bowl. Mix cognac mixture into meat with salt and pepper.

Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.  
2B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes.  
3. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place burgers on grill (on hot side if using charcoal) and cook, without pressing on them, until well browned on first side, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip burgers and cook 3 to 4 minutes for medium-well or 4 to 5 minutes for well-done, adding cheese, if using, about 2 minutes before reaching desired doneness and covering grill to melt cheese.  
4. Transfer burgers to serving platter, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving on rolls.  
WELL-DONE BACON-CHEESEBURGERS  
Most bacon burgers simply top the burgers with bacon. We also add bacon fat to the ground beef, which adds juiciness and unmistakable bacon flavor throughout the burger.  
Cook 8 slices bacon in skillet over medium heat until crisp, 7 to 9 minutes. Transfer bacon to paper towel–lined plate and set aside. Reserve 2 tablespoons fat and refrigerate until just warm. Follow recipe for Grilled Well-Done Hamburgers, including optional cheese and adding reserved bacon fat to beef mixture. Top each burger with 2 slices bacon before serving.

#ingredients  
Sirloin steak tips are sometimes labeled “flap meat.” A two-level fire allows you to brown the steak over the hot side of the grill, then move it to the cooler side if it is not yet cooked through. If your steak is thin, however, you may not need to use the cooler side of the grill. Serve lime wedges with the Southwestern-marinated tips, orange wedges with the tips marinated in garlic, ginger, and soy sauce, and lemon wedges with the garlic-herb marinade.

1B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave one burner on high and turn other burner(s) to medium.  
2. Clean and oil cooking grate. Pat steaks dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Place steaks on grill (hotter side if using charcoal) and cook, uncovered, until well browned on both sides, 4 to 6 minutes, flipping steaks halfway through cooking. Move steaks to cooler side of grill (if using charcoal) or turn all burners to medium (if using gas) and continue to cook until meat registers 115 to 120 degrees (for rare) or 120 to 125 degrees (for medium-rare) 5 to 8 minutes longer.  
3. Transfer steaks to serving platter, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 minutes before serving.  
AVOIDING CROSS-CONTAMINATION  
Grilled meat, poultry, and fish should not be returned to the same platter that was used to carry the raw food to the grill. Instead of last-minute fumbling for a clean platter, this method uses a single platter for both jobs and saves on cleanup time.  
#instructions  
1. Cover platter with aluminum foil before placing raw food on it.  
2. While food is grilling, remove foil so that you can use same platter when food comes off grill.

#ingredients  
Our preferred steak for this recipe is strip steak, also known as New York strip. A less expensive alternative is a boneless shell sirloin steak (or top sirloin steak). Four medium wood chunks, unsoaked, can be substituted for the wood chip packets on a charcoal grill.  
SAUCE  
1⁄4 cup hot water  
2 teaspoons dried oregano  
1 teaspoon salt  
1-1⁄3 cups parsley leaves  
2⁄3 cup cilantro leaves

Pulse parsley, cilantro, garlic, and pepper flakes in food processor until coarsely chopped, about 10 pulses. Add water mixture and vinegar and pulse to combine. Transfer mixture to bowl and slowly whisk in oil until emulsified. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour.  
2. FOR THE STEAKS: Combine cornstarch and salt in bowl. Pat steaks dry with paper towels and place on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Rub entire surface of steaks with cornstarch mixture and place steaks, uncovered, in freezer until very firm, about 30 minutes.  
3. Using 2 large pieces of heavy-duty aluminum foil, wrap soaked chips in 2 foil packets and cut several vent holes in tops.  
4A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent halfway. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over grill. Place wood chip packet on coals. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent halfway. Heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 5 minutes.  
4B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Place wood chip packet directly on primary burner. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 15 minutes. Leave all burners on high.  
5. Clean and oil cooking grate. Season steaks with pepper. Place steaks on grill, cover, and cook until beginning to brown on both sides, 4 to 6 minutes, flipping halfway through cooking.  
6. Flip steaks and cook until well browned on first side, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip steaks and continue to cook until meat registers 115 to 120 degrees (for rare) or 120 to 125 degrees (for medium-rare), 2 to 6 minutes longer.

5. Place steak on grill (on hot side if using charcoal) and cook, flipping steak every minute, until dark brown crust forms on both sides, 8 to 12 minutes. Move steak to cooler side of grill (if using charcoal) or turn all burners to medium (if using gas). Cover and continue to cook until meat registers 115 to 120 degrees (for rare) or 120 to 125 degrees (for medium-rare), 6 to 12 minutes longer, flipping steak halfway through cooking.

SWEET AND SMOKY GRILLED TOMATO SALSA  
#quantity

#ingredients  
Sugar and lime juice should be added at the end to taste, depending on the ripeness of the tomatoes. To make this salsa spicier, add the chile seeds.

1 cup wood chips, soaked in water for 15 minutes and drained  
2 pounds plum tomatoes, cored and halved lengthwise  
2 large jalapeño chiles  
2 teaspoons vegetable oil  
3 tablespoons minced red onion  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro  
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  
Salt and pepper

#instructions  
1. Using large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, wrap soaked chips in foil packet and cut several vent holes in top.

SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
Look for a flank steak measuring approximately 8 by 6 inches, with the grain running the long way. Depending on the steak’s size, you may have more or less than 8 slices of meat at the end of step 2. You will need both wooden skewers and kitchen twine for this recipe.  
2 tablespoons olive oil  
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley  
1 small shallot, minced  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
1 teaspoon minced fresh sage  
1 (2- to 2-1⁄2-pound) flank steak, trimmed  
4 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto  
4 ounces thinly sliced provolone cheese  
Salt and pepper  
#instructions  
1. Combine oil, parsley, shallot, garlic, and sage in bowl.  
2. Soak 8 to 12 wooden skewers in warm water to cover (you will need 1 skewer per inch of rolled steak length) for 30 minutes. Drain, dry, and set aside.  
3. Lay steak on cutting board with grain running parallel to counter edge. Cut horizontally through meat, leaving 1⁄2-inch “hinge” along top edge. Open up steak and pound flat into rough rectangle, trimming any ragged edges. Rub herb mixture evenly over opened side of steak. Lay prosciutto evenly over steak, leaving 2-inch border along top edge. Cover prosciutto with even layer of cheese, leaving 2-inch border along top edge. Starting from short edge, roll beef into tight log and place on cutting board seam side down.  
4. Starting 1⁄2 inch from end of rolled steak, evenly space eight to twelve 14-inch pieces of kitchen twine at 1-inch intervals underneath steak. Tie middle piece first, then, working from outer pieces toward center, tightly tie roll and turn tied steak 90 degrees so seam is facing you.  
5. Skewer beef directly through outer flap of steak near seam through each piece of twine, allowing skewers to extend 1⁄2 inch on other side. Using chef’s knife, slice roll between each piece of twine into 1-inch-thick pinwheels. Season pinwheels with salt and pepper.  
6A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter three-quarters filled with charcoal briquettes (4-1⁄2 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.  
6B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes.  
7. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place pinwheels on grill (hot side if using charcoal) and cook (covered if using gas) until well browned on both sides, 6 to 12 minutes, flipping halfway through cooking. Move pinwheels to cool side of grill (if using charcoal) or turn all burners to medium (if using gas). Cover and cook until meat registers 125 to 130 degrees (for medium-rare) or 130 to 135 degrees (for medium), 1 to 5 minutes.  
8. Transfer pinwheels to serving platter, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove and discard skewers and twine and serve.  
GRILLED STUFFED FLANK STEAK WITH SPINACH AND PINE NUTS  
Microwave 4 ounces chopped spinach, 1 tablespoon water, 1⁄2 teaspoon pepper, and 1⁄2 teaspoon salt in bowl until spinach is wilted and decreased in volume by half, 3 to 4 minutes. Cool completely, then stir in 1⁄4 cup toasted pine nuts. Replace prosciutto with spinach mixture.  
GRILLED STUFFED FLANK STEAK WITH SUN-DRIED TOMATOES AND CAPERS  
Combine 1⁄2 cup drained and chopped sun-dried tomatoes, 1⁄2 cup shredded Asiago cheese, and 1⁄4 cup rinsed and chopped capers in bowl. Replace prosciutto with sun-dried tomato mixture.  
HOW TO BUTTERFLY AND STUFF FLANK STEAK  
#instructions  
1. Butterfly meat by cutting through steak horizontally, leaving 1⁄2-inch “hinge” along top edge.  
2. Open up steak and pound flat into rough rectangle, trimming any ragged edges.  
3. Rub with herb mixture; layer with prosciutto and cheese, leaving 2-inch border at top, Roll into tight log.  
4. Place steak seam side down and tie with kitchen twine at 1-inch intervals, starting at center.  
5. Skewer steak directly through each piece of twine, allowing skewer to extend 1⁄2 inch on opposite side.  
6. Slice steak between pieces of twine into 1-inch-thick pinwheels.

INEXPENSIVE GRILL-ROASTED BEEF WITH GARLIC AND ROSEMARY  
#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
A pair of kitchen shears works well for punching the holes in the aluminum pan. We prefer a top sirloin roast, but you can substitute a top round or bottom round roast. Start this recipe the day before you plan to grill so the salt rub has time to flavor and tenderize the meat.  
6 garlic cloves, minced  
2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary  
4 teaspoons kosher salt  
1 tablespoon pepper  
1 (3- to 4-pound) top sirloin roast  
1 (13 by 9-inch) disposable aluminum roasting pan  
#instructions  
1. Combine garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper in bowl. Sprinkle all sides of roast evenly with salt mixture, wrap with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 18 to 24 hours.  
2A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent halfway. Light large chimney starter half filled with charcoal briquettes (3 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over one-third of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent halfway. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.  
2B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Turn primary burner to medium and turn off other burner(s). (Adjust primary burner as needed during cooking to maintain grill temperature between 250 and 300 degrees.)  
3. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place roast on grill (hot side if using charcoal) and cook (covered if using gas) until well browned on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes, turning as needed. (If flare-ups occur, move roast to cooler side of grill until flames die down.)  
4. Meanwhile, punch fifteen 1⁄4-inch holes in center of disposable pan in area roughly same size as roast. Once browned, place beef in pan over holes and set pan over cool side of grill (if using charcoal) or turn all burners to medium (if using gas). (Adjust burners as needed during cooking to maintain grill temperature between 250 and 300 degrees.) Cover and cook until meat registers 120 to 125 degrees (for medium-rare) or 130 to 135 degrees (for medium), 40 minutes to 1 hour, rotating pan halfway through cooking.  
5. Transfer meat to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 20 minutes. Transfer meat to carving board, slice thin against grain, and serve.

#title  
CHARCOAL GRILL–ROASTED PRIME RIB  
#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
Your butcher can remove the bones and trim excess fat from the roast; just make sure that the bones are packed up along with the meat, as you need them to protect the meat from overbrowning. Two medium wood chunks, soaked in water for 1 hour, can be substituted for the wood chip packet on a charcoal grill. Serve the roast with HORSERADISH CREAM SAUCE, if desired.  
1 (7-pound) first-cut (3- or 4-rib) beef standing rib roast, meat removed from bones, bones reserved, exterior fat trimmed to 1⁄8 inch  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
Pepper  
1⁄4 cup kosher salt  
2 cups wood chips, soaked in water for 15 minutes and drained  
1 (16 by 12-inch) disposable aluminum roasting pan (if using charcoal)  
#instructions  
1. Pat roast dry with paper towels, rub with oil, and season with pepper. Spread salt on rimmed baking sheet and press roast into salt to coat evenly on all sides. Tie meat back onto bones exactly from where it was cut, passing 2 lengths of kitchen twine between each set of bones and knotting securely. Refrigerate roast, uncovered, for 1 hour, then let sit at room temperature for 2 hours.  
2. Using large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, wrap soaked chips in foil packet and cut several vent holes in top.  
3A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent halfway and place roasting pan on one side of grill. Light large chimney starter three-quarters filled with charcoal briquettes (4-1⁄2 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill (opposite roasting pan). Place wood chip packet on coals. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent halfway. Heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 5 minutes.  
3B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 15 minutes. Turn primary burner to medium and turn off other burner(s). (Adjust primary burner as needed during cooking to maintain grill temperature around 325 degrees.)  
4. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place roast on hot side of grill and cook (covered if using gas) until well browned on all sides, 10 to 15 minutes, turning as needed. (If flare-ups occur, move roast to cooler side of grill until flames die down.)  
5. Transfer roast to rimmed baking sheet. If using charcoal, remove cooking grate and place wood chip packet on pile of coals; set cooking grate in place. If using gas, place wood chip packet directly on primary burner. Place roast on cool side of grill, bone side down, with tips of bones pointed away from fire. Cover (position lid vent over meat if using charcoal) and cook until meat registers 115 to 120 degrees (for rare) or 120 to 125 degrees (for medium-rare), 2 to 2-1⁄2 hours.  
6. Transfer roast to carving board, tent loosely with foil, and let rest for 20 minutes. Remove twine and bones, cut into 1⁄2-inch-thick slices, and serve.  
GRILL-ROASTED PRIME RIB WITH GARLIC-ROSEMARY CRUST  
Combine 1⁄2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 12 minced garlic cloves (1⁄4 cup), and 1⁄4 cup minced fresh rosemary in bowl. Brush paste onto roast after browning.  
GRILL-ROASTED WHOLE PRIME RIB  
A whole prime rib roast can weigh as much as 20 pounds and easily serves a crowd (16 to 20 people). Because the whole rib tapers slightly, expect the smaller end to be slightly more cooked than the thicker end.  
Substitute 1 whole beef standing rib roast for first-cut roast and increase salt to 1⁄2 cup. If using charcoal, after roast cooks on cool side of grill for 1-1⁄4 hours, transfer roast to rimmed baking sheet; light additional large chimney starter three-quarters filled with charcoal briquettes (4-1⁄2 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill (opposite roasting pan). Set cooking grate in place and return roast to cool side of grill. Cover and continue to cook for 2-1⁄2 to 3 hours longer.

GRILL-ROASTED BEEF TENDERLOIN  
#quantity  
SERVES 10 TO 12  
#ingredients  
Beef tenderloins purchased from wholesale clubs require a good amount of trimming before cooking. At the grocery store, however, you may have the option of having the butcher trim it for you. Once trimmed, and with the butt tenderloin still attached (the butt tenderloin is the lobe attached to the large end of the roast), the roast should weigh 4-1⁄2 to 5 pounds. If you purchase an already-trimmed tenderloin without the butt tenderloin attached, begin checking for doneness about 5 minutes early. When using a charcoal grill, we prefer wood chunks to wood chips whenever possible; substitute 2 medium wood chunks, soaked in water for 1 hour, for the wood chip packet (if using). Serve with Cilantro-Parsley Sauce with Pickled Jalapeños, Romesco Sauce, or Salsa Verde (recipes follow), if desired.  
1 (6-pound) beef tenderloin, trimmed of fat and silver skin, tail end tucked and tied with kitchen twine at 2-inch intervals  
1-1⁄2 tablespoons kosher salt  
2 cups wood chips, soaked in water for 15 minutes and drained (optional)  
2 tablespoons olive oil  
1 tablespoon pepper  
#instructions  
1. Pat tenderloin dry with paper towels and rub with salt. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour.  
2. Using large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, wrap soaked wood chips, if using, in foil packet and cut several vent holes in top.  
3A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent halfway. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Place wood chip packet, if using, on coals. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent halfway. Heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 5 minutes.  
3B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Place wood chip packet, if using, over primary burner. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and off other burner(s). (Adjust primary burner as needed during cooking to maintain grill temperature around 350 degrees.)  
4. Clean and oil cooking grate. Rub tenderloin with oil and season with pepper. Place roast on hot side of grill and cook (covered if using gas) until well browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes, turning as needed. (If flare-ups occur, move roast to cooler side of grill until flames die down.)  
5. Move roast to cool side of grill, cover (position lid vent over meat if using charcoal), and cook until meat registers 115 to 120 degrees (for rare) or 120 to 125 degrees (for medium-rare), 15 to 30 minutes.  
6. Transfer roast to carving board, tent loosely with foil, and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove twine, cut into 1⁄2-inch-thick slices, and serve.

CILANTRO-PARSLEY SAUCE WITH PICKLED JALAPEÑOS  
#quantity  
MAKES ABOUT 1-1⁄2 CUPS  
#ingredients  
This sauce will discolor if left to sit for too long; it’s best served within 4 hours of making it.  
2–3 slices hearty white sandwich bread, crusts removed, bread lightly toasted and cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces (1 cup)  
1 cup extra-virgin olive oil  
1⁄4 cup lemon juice (2 lemons)  
2 cups fresh cilantro leaves  
2 cups fresh parsley leaves  
3 tablespoons chopped pickled jalapeño slices  
1 garlic clove, minced  
Salt  
Process bread, oil, and lemon juice in food processor until smooth, 10 to 15 seconds. Add cilantro, parsley, jalapeños, garlic, and 1⁄4 teaspoon salt and pulse until finely chopped (mixture should not be smooth), about 10 pulses. Season with salt to taste and transfer to serving bowl.

ROMESCO SAUCE  
#quantity  
MAKES ABOUT 2 CUPS  
#ingredients  
In addition to being an excellent accompaniment to beef, fish, and poultry, this sauce is also terrific spread on toasted bread or used as a dip for crudités.  
1–2 slices hearty white sandwich bread, crusts removed, bread lightly toasted, and cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces (1⁄2 cup)  
3 tablespoons slivered almonds, toasted  
1-3⁄4 cups jarred roasted red peppers  
1 small ripe tomato, cored, seeded, and chopped  
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  
1-1⁄2 tablespoons sherry vinegar  
1 large garlic clove, minced  
1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
Salt  
Process bread and almonds in food processor until nuts are finely ground, 10 to 15 seconds. Add red peppers, tomato, oil, vinegar, garlic, cayenne, and 1⁄2 teaspoon salt. Process until mixture has texture similar to mayonnaise, 20 to 30 seconds. Season with salt to taste and transfer to serving bowl. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.)  
TRIMMING A BEEF TENDERLOIN  
Although wholesale clubs offer whole beef tenderloins at an affordable price, most come “unpeeled,” with the fat and silver skin (a tough membrane) intact. Here’s how to trim a tenderloin for the grill. Expect to lose between 1 and 1-1⁄2 pounds during the trimming process. A boning knife is the best tool for this task.  
#instructions  
1. Pull away outer layer of fat to expose fatty chain of meat.  
2. Pull chain of fat away from roast, cut it off, and discard chain.  
3. Scrape silver skin at creases in thick end to expose lobes.  
4. Trim silver skin by slicing under it and cutting upward.  
5. Remove remaining silver skin in creases at thick end.  
6. Turn tenderloin over and remove fat from underside.

KOREAN GRILLED SHORT RIBS (KALBI)  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
Make sure to buy English-style ribs that have at least 1 inch of meat on top of the bone, avoiding ones that have little meat and large bones. Two pounds of boneless short ribs at least 4 inches long and 1 inch thick can be used instead of bone-in ribs. Alternatively, 2-1⁄2 pounds of thinly sliced Korean-style ribs can be used (no butchering is required), but if using charcoal, reduce to 3 quarts. Serve with steamed rice, kimchi (spicy pickled vegetables), and, if available, a spicy bean paste called gochujang. Traditionally, all these ingredients are wrapped in a lettuce leaf with the meat and eaten like a taco.  
1 ripe pear, peeled, cored, and chopped coarse  
1⁄2 cup soy sauce  
6 tablespoons sugar  
2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil  
6 garlic cloves, peeled  
4 teaspoons minced fresh ginger  
1 tablespoon rice vinegar  
3 scallions, sliced thin  
1⁄2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)  
5 pounds bone-in English-style short ribs, meat removed from bone, trimmed, sliced widthwise at angle into 1⁄2- to 3⁄4-inch-thick pieces, and pounded 1⁄4 inch thick  
#instructions  
1. Process pear, soy sauce, sugar, oil, garlic, ginger, and vinegar in food processor until smooth, 20 to 30 seconds. Transfer to medium bowl and stir in scallions and pepper flakes, if using.  
2. Spread one-third of marinade in 13 by 9-inch pan. Place half of meat in single layer over marinade. Pour half of remaining marinade over meat, followed by remaining meat and marinade. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 12 hours, turning meat once or twice.  
3A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter three-quarters filled with charcoal briquettes (4-1⁄2 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour into even layer over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.  
3B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and turn off other burner(s).  
4. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place half of meat on hot side of grill and cook (covered if using gas), turning every 2 to 3 minutes, until well browned on both sides, 8 to 13 minutes. Move first batch of meat to cool side of grill and repeat browning with second batch.  
5. Transfer second batch of meat to serving platter. Return first batch of meat to hot side of grill and warm for 30 seconds; transfer to serving platter and serve.  
GETTING ENGLISH-STYLE RIBS READY TO GRILL

BARBECUED BEEF BRISKET  
#quantity  
SERVES 8 TO 10  
#ingredients  
If your brisket is smaller than 5 pounds or the fat cap has been removed, or if you are using a small charcoal grill, it may be necessary to build an aluminum foil shield in order to keep the brisket from becoming too dark. If using the fattier point cut, omit the step of brining. Two medium wood chunks, soaked in water for 1 hour, can be substituted for the wood chip packet on a charcoal grill. Some of the traditional accompaniments to barbecued brisket include barbecue sauce , sliced white bread or saltines, pickle chips, and thinly sliced onion.  
1 (5- to 6-pound) beef brisket, flat cut  
2⁄3 cup table salt  
1⁄2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar  
2 cups wood chips, soaked in water for 15 minutes and drained  
3 tablespoons kosher salt  
2 tablespoons pepper  
1 (13 by 9-inch) disposable aluminum roasting pan (if using charcoal)  
#instructions  
1. Using sharp knife, cut slits in fat cap, spaced 1 inch apart, in crosshatch pattern, being careful to not cut into meat. Dissolve table salt and 1⁄2 cup sugar in 4 quarts cold water in large container. Submerge brisket in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 2 hours.  
2. Using large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, wrap soaked chips in foil packet and cut several vent holes in top.  
3. Combine remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, kosher salt, and pepper in bowl. Remove brisket from brine and pat dry with paper towels. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet and rub salt mixture over entire brisket and into slits.  
4A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent halfway. Arrange 3 quarts unlit charcoal banked against 1 side of grill and disposable pan on empty side of grill. Light large chimney starter three-quarters filled with charcoal (4-1⁄2 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour on top of unlit charcoal, to cover one-third of grill with coals steeply banked against side of grill. Place wood chip packet on top of coals. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent halfway. Heat grill until hot and wood chips begin to smoke, about 5 minutes.  
4B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Place wood chip packet directly on primary burner. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot and wood chips begin to smoke, about 15 minutes. Turn primary burner to medium and turn off other burner(s). (Adjust primary burner as needed during cooking to maintain grill temperature between 250 and 300 degrees.)  
5. Line rimmed baking sheet with foil and set wire rack inside. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place brisket on cool side of grill, fat side down, as far away from coals and flames as possible with thickest side facing coals and flames. Loosely tent meat with foil. Cover (position lid vent over meat if using charcoal) and cook for 3 hours. Transfer brisket to prepared baking sheet.  
6. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Roast brisket until tender and meat registers 195 degrees, 1-1⁄2 to 2 hours.

Two medium wood chunks, soaked in water for 1 hour, can be substituted for the wood chip packet on a charcoal grill. You will need two 10-inch metal skewers for this recipe.  
SAUCE  
1⁄2 cup ketchup  
1⁄4 cup molasses  
2 tablespoons grated onion  
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce  
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard  
2 tablespoons cider vinegar  
1 tablespoon packed light brown sugar

2 cups wood chips, soaked in water for 15 minutes and drained  
4 (12-ounce) bone-in pork rib chops, 1-1⁄2 inches thick, trimmed  
2 teaspoons salt  
2 teaspoons pepper  
1 (13 by 9-inch) disposable aluminum roasting pan (if using charcoal)

2. FOR THE CHOPS: Using large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, wrap soaked chips in foil packet and cut several vent holes in top. Pat pork chops dry with paper towels. Use sharp knife to cut 2 slits about 1 inch apart through outer layer of fat and connective tissue. Season each chop with 1⁄2 teaspoon salt and 1⁄2 teaspoon pepper. Place chops side by side, facing in same direction, on cutting board with curved rib bone facing down. Pass 2 skewers through loin muscle of each chop, close to bone, about 1 inch from each end, then pull apart to create 1-inch space between each.  
3A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent halfway and place roasting pan in center of grill. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour into 2 even piles on either side of roasting pan. Place wood chip packet on 1 pile of coals.

3B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Place wood chip packet over primary burner. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 15 minutes. Turn all burners to medium-high. (Adjust burners as needed during cooking to maintain grill temperature between 300 and 325 degrees.)  
4. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place skewered chops bone side down on grill (in center if using charcoal). Cover and cook until meat registers 120 degrees, 28 to 32 minutes.  
5. Remove skewers from chops, tip chops onto flat side and brush surface of each with 1 tablespoon sauce. Transfer chops, sauce side down, to hotter parts of grill (if using charcoal) or turn all burners to high (if using gas) and cook until browned on first side, 2 to 6 minutes.

GRILL-ROASTED BONE-IN PORK RIB ROAST  
#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
If you buy a blade-end roast (sometimes called a “rib-end roast”), tie it into a uniform shape with kitchen twine at 1-inch intervals; this step is unnecessary with a center-cut roast. For easier carving, ask the butcher to remove the tip of the chine bone and to cut the remainder of the chine bone between each rib. One medium wood chunk, soaked in water for 1 hour, can be substituted for the wood chip packet on a charcoal grill.  
1 (4- to 5-pound) center-cut rib or blade-end bone-in pork roast, tip of chine bone removed, fat trimmed to 1⁄4-inch thickness  
4 teaspoons kosher salt  
1 cup wood chips, soaked in water for 15 minutes and drained  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons pepper  
1 recipe ORANGE SALSA WITH CUBAN FLAVORS (optional; recipe follows)  
#instructions  
1. Pat roast dry with paper towels. Using sharp knife, cut slits in surface fat layer, spaced 1 inch apart, in crosshatch pattern, being careful not to cut into meat. Season roast with salt. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or up to 24 hours.  
2. Using large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, wrap soaked chips in foil packet and cut several vent holes in top.  
3A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent halfway. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour into steeply banked pile against side of grill. Place wood chip packet on coals. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent halfway. Heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 5 minutes.  
3B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Place wood chip packet over primary burner. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 15 minutes. Turn primary burner to medium-high and turn off other burner(s). (Adjust primary burner as needed during cooking to maintain grill temperature around 325 degrees.)  
4. Clean and oil cooking grate. Unwrap roast and season with pepper. Place roast on grate with meat near, but not over, coals and flames and bones facing away from coals and flames. Cover (position lid vent over meat if using charcoal) and cook until meat registers 140 degrees, 1-1⁄4 to 1-1⁄2 hours.  
5. Transfer roast to carving board, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 30 minutes. Carve into thick slices by cutting between ribs. Serve, passing salsa, if using, separately.

GRILLED PORK LOIN WITH APPLE-CRANBERRY FILLING  
#quantity  
SERVES 6  
#ingredients  
This recipe is best prepared with a loin that is 7 to 8-inches long and 4 to 5 inches wide and not enhanced (injected with a salt solution). To make cutting the pork easier, freeze it for 30 minutes. If mustard seeds are unavailable, stir an equal amount of whole grain mustard into the filling after the apples have been processed. Use more or less cayenne, depending on how spicy you’d like the stuffing. The pork loin can be stuffed and tied a day ahead of time, but don’t season the exterior until you are ready to grill. Two medium wood chunks, soaked in water for 1 hour, can be substituted for the wood chip packet on a charcoal grill.  
FILLING  
1-1⁄2 cups packed dried apples  
1 cup apple cider  
3⁄4 cup packed light brown sugar  
1⁄2 cup cider vinegar  
1⁄2 cup packed dried cranberries  
1 large shallot, halved lengthwise and sliced thin crosswise  
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger  
1 tablespoon yellow mustard seeds  
1⁄2 teaspoon ground allspice  
1⁄8–1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
PORK  
2 cups wood chips, soaked in water for 15 minutes and drained  
1 (2-1⁄2-pound) boneless center-cut pork loin roast, trimmed  
Salt and pepper  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE FILLING: Bring all ingredients to simmer in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until apples are very soft, about 20 minutes. Pour mixture through fine-mesh strainer set over bowl, pressing with back of spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Return liquid to saucepan and simmer over medium-high heat until reduced to 1⁄3 cup, about 5 minutes; reserve for glazing. Pulse apple mixture in food processor until coarsely chopped, about 15 pulses. Transfer filling to bowl and refrigerate until needed.  
2. FOR THE PORK: Position roast fat side up. Insert knife 1⁄2 inch from bottom of roast and cut horizontally, stopping 1⁄2 inch before edge. Open up this flap. Cut through thicker half of roast about 1⁄2 inch from bottom, stopping about 1⁄2 inch before edge. Open up this flap. Repeat until pork loin is even 1⁄2 inch thickness throughout. If uneven, cover with plastic wrap and use meat pounder to even. Season interior with salt pepper and spread filling in even layer, leaving 1⁄2-inch border. Roll tightly and tie with kitchen twine at 1-inch intervals. Season with salt and pepper.  
3. Using large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, wrap soaked chips in foil packet and cut several vent holes in top.  
4A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent halfway (and place roasting pan on 1 side of grill). Light large chimney starter three-quarters filled with charcoal briquettes (4-1⁄2 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Place wood chip packet on coals. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent halfway. Heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 5 minutes.  
4B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Place wood chip packet directly on primary burner. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on medium-high and turn off other burner(s). (Adjust primary burner as needed during cooking to maintain grill temperature between 300 and 325 degrees.)  
5. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place pork loin, fat side up, on cool side of grill, cover (position lid vent over roast if using charcoal), and cook until meat registers 130 to 135 degrees, 55 minutes to 1 hour 10 minutes, flipping halfway through cooking.  
6. Brush roast evenly with reserved glaze. (You may need to reheat glaze briefly to make it spreadable.) Continue to cook until glaze is thick and glossy and meat registers 145 degrees, 5 to 10 minutes longer.  
7. Transfer roast to carving board, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 15 minutes. Remove twine, cut roast into 1⁄2-inch-thick slices, and serve.  
GRILLED PORK LOIN WITH APPLE-CHERRY FILLING WITH CARAWAY

BARBECUED PULLED PORK  
#quantity  
SERVES 8  
#ingredients  
Pulled pork can be made with a fresh ham or picnic roast, although our preference is for Boston butt. If using a fresh ham or picnic roast, remove the skin by cutting through it with the tip of a chef’s knife; slide the blade just under the skin and work around to loosen it while pulling it off with your other hand. Four medium wood chunks, soaked in water for 1 hour, can be substituted for the wood chip packet on a charcoal grill. Serve on plain white bread or warmed rolls with dill pickle chips and coleslaw.  
3⁄4 cup DRY RUB FOR BARBECUE  
1 (6- to 8-pound) bone-in Boston butt roast  
4 cups wood chips, soaked in water for 15 minutes and drained  
1 (13 by 9-inch) disposable aluminum roasting pan  
2 cups barbecue sauce (recipes follow)  
#instructions  
1. Pat pork dry with paper towels, then massage dry rub into meat. Wrap meat in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to 3 days.  
2. At least 1 hour prior to cooking, remove roast from refrigerator, unwrap, and let sit at room temperature. Using 2 large pieces of heavy-duty aluminum foil, wrap soaked chips in 2 foil packets and cut several vent holes in tops.  
3A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent halfway. Light large chimney starter three-quarters filled with charcoal briquettes (4-1⁄2 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Place wood chip packet on coals. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent halfway. Heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 5 minutes.  
3B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Place wood chip packet directly on primary burner. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 15 minutes. Turn primary burner to medium-high and turn off other burner(s). (Adjust primary burner as needed to maintain grill temperature around 325 degrees.)  
4. Clean and oil cooking grate. Set roast in disposable pan, place on cool side of grill, and cook for 3 hours. During final 20 minutes of cooking, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees.  
5. Wrap disposable pan with heavy-duty foil and cook in oven until meat is fork-tender, about 2 hours.  
6. Carefully slide foil-wrapped pan with roast into brown paper bag. Crimp end shut and let rest for 1 hour.  
7. Transfer roast to carving board and unwrap. Separate roast into muscle sections, removing fat, if desired, and tearing meat into shreds with your fingers. Place shredded meat in large bowl and toss with 1 cup barbecue sauce. Serve, passing remaining sauce separately.

GRILLED BLACKENED RED SNAPPER  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
Striped bass, halibut, or grouper can be substituted for the snapper; if the fillets are thicker or thinner, they will have slightly different cooking times. For a gas grill, we super-heat the cooking grate by pressing aluminum foil directly onto the surface before cooking; be sure to use heavy-duty foil (thin foil will melt), and skip this step if your grill has ceramic cooking grates (it may damage the ceramic). Serve the fish with lemon wedges, Rémoulade, or Pineapple and Cucumber Salsa with Mint (recipes follow).  
2 tablespoons paprika  
2 teaspoons onion powder  
2 teaspoons garlic powder  
3⁄4 teaspoon ground coriander  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
1⁄4 teaspoon black pepper  
1⁄4 teaspoon white pepper  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter  
4 (6- to 8-ounce) red snapper fillets, 3⁄4 inch thick  
#instructions  
1. Combine paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, coriander, salt, cayenne, black pepper, and white pepper in bowl. Melt butter in 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Stir in spice mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant and spices turn dark rust color, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer mixture to pie plate and let cool to room temperature. Use a fork to break up any large clumps.  
2A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter three-quarters filled with charcoal briquettes (4-1⁄2 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.  
2B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes.  
3. Clean cooking grate, then repeatedly brush grate with well-oiled paper towels until black and glossy, 5 to 10 times.  
4. Meanwhile, pat fillets dry with paper towels. Using sharp knife, make shallow diagonal slashes every inch along skin side of fish, being careful not to cut into flesh. Place fillets skin side up on large plate. Using your fingers, rub spice mixture in thin, even layer on top and sides of fish. Flip fillets over and repeat on other side (you should use all of spice mixture).  
5. Place fish skin side down on grill (hot side if using charcoal) with fillets diagonal to grate. Cook until skin is very dark brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully flip fish and continue to cook until dark brown and beginning to flake and center is opaque but still moist, about 5 minutes longer. Serve.

GRILLED POTATOES WITH GARLIC AND ROSEMARY  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
This recipe allows you to grill an entrée while the hot coals burn down in step 1. Once that item is done, start grilling the potatoes. This recipe works best with small potatoes that are about 1-1⁄2 inches in diameter. If using medium potatoes, 2 to 3 inches in diameter, cut them into quarters. If the potatoes are larger than 3 inches in diameter, cut each potato into eighths. Since the potatoes are first cooked in the microwave, use wooden skewers.  
1⁄4 cup olive oil  
9 garlic cloves, minced  
1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary  
Salt and pepper  
2 pounds small red potatoes, halved and skewered  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives  
#instructions  
1. Heat oil, garlic, rosemary, and 1⁄2 teaspoon salt in small skillet over medium heat until sizzling, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook until garlic is light blond, about 3 minutes. Pour mixture through fine-mesh strainer into small bowl; press on solids. Measure 1 tablespoon of solids and 1 tablespoon of oil into large bowl and set aside. Discard remaining solids but reserve remaining oil.  
2. Place skewered potatoes in single layer on large plate and poke each potato several times with skewer. Brush with 1 tablespoon of strained oil and season with salt. Microwave until the potatoes offer slight resistance when pierced with paring knife, about 8 minutes, turning halfway through cooking. Transfer potatoes to baking sheet coated with 1 tablespoon of strained oil. Brush with remaining 1 tablespoon strained oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.  
3A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour two-thirds evenly over grill, then pour remaining coals over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.  
3B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Turn all burners down to medium-high.  
4. Place potatoes on grill (hotter side if using charcoal) and cook (covered if using gas) until grill marks appear, 3 to 5 minutes, flipping halfway through cooking. Move potatoes to cooler side of grill (if using charcoal) or turn all burners to medium-low (if using gas). Cover and continue to cook until paring knife slips in and out of potatoes easily, 5 to 8 minutes longer.  
5. Remove potatoes from skewers and transfer to bowl with reserved garlic-oil mixture. Add chives, season with salt and pepper to taste, and toss until thoroughly coated. Serve.  
GRILLED POTATOES WITH OREGANO AND LEMON  
Serve this variation with lemon wedges, if desired.  
Reduce garlic to 3 cloves, substitute 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano for rosemary, and add 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest to oil in skillet. Substitute 2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano for chives and add an additional 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest to potatoes when they come off grill.  
SKEWERING POTATOES FOR THE GRILL  
Place potato half cut side down on counter and pierce center with skewer. Repeat, holding already-skewered potatoes for better leverage.

When cooking the eggs, it is important to lift the edges of the omelet rather than push them toward the center.  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter  
8 ounces asparagus, trimmed and cut on bias into 1⁄4-inch pieces  
Salt and pepper  
1 shallot, halved and sliced thin  
1 teaspoon lemon juice  
5 large eggs  
1-1⁄2 ounces Gruyère cheese, shredded fine (1⁄3 cup)

PERFECT FRENCH OMELETS  
#quantity  
SERVES 2  
#ingredients  
Because making omelets is such a quick process, make sure to have all your ingredients and equipment at the ready. If you don’t have skewers or chopsticks to stir the eggs in step 3, use the handle of a wooden spoon. Warm the plates in a 200-degree oven.  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 2 pieces  
1⁄2 teaspoon vegetable oil  
6 large eggs, chilled  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
Pepper  
2 tablespoons shredded Gruyère cheese  
4 teaspoons minced fresh chives  
#instructions  
1. Cut 1 tablespoon butter in half. Cut remaining 1 tablespoon butter into small pieces, transfer to small bowl, and place in freezer while preparing eggs and skillet, at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat oil in 8-inch nonstick skillet over low heat for 10 minutes.  
2. Crack 2 eggs into medium bowl and separate third egg; reserve egg white for another use and add egg yolk to bowl. Add salt and pinch pepper. Break egg yolks with fork, then beat eggs at moderate pace, about 80 strokes, until yolks and whites are well combined. Stir in half of frozen butter cubes.  
3. When skillet is fully heated, use paper towels to wipe out oil, leaving thin film on bottom and sides of skillet. Add 1⁄2 tablespoon of reserved butter to skillet and heat until melted. Swirl butter to coat skillet, add egg mixture, and increase heat to medium-high. Use 2 chopsticks or wooden skewers to scramble eggs, using quick circular motion to move around skillet, scraping cooked egg from side of skillet as you go, until eggs are almost cooked but still slightly runny, 45 to 90 seconds. Turn off heat (remove skillet from heat if using electric burner) and smooth eggs into even layer using heatproof rubber spatula. Sprinkle omelet with 1 tablespoon Gruyère and 2 teaspoons chives. Cover skillet with tight-fitting lid and let sit for 1 minute for runnier omelet or 2 minutes for firmer omelet.  
4. Heat skillet over low heat for 20 seconds, uncover, and, using rubber spatula, loosen edges of omelet from skillet. Place folded square of paper towel onto warmed plate and slide omelet out of skillet onto paper towel so that omelet lies flat on plate and hangs about 1 inch off paper towel. Roll omelet into neat cylinder and set aside. Return skillet to low heat and heat for 2 minutes before repeating instructions for second omelet starting with step 2. Serve.

2. FOR THE TORTILLAS AND EGGS: Brush both sides of each tortilla lightly with oil, sprinkle both sides with salt, and place on clean baking sheet. Bake until tops just begin to color, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip tortillas and continue to bake until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes longer.  
3. Meanwhile, bring salsa to gentle simmer in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Remove from heat and make 4 shallow wells in salsa with back of large spoon. Break 1 egg into cup, then carefully pour egg into well in salsa; repeat with remaining eggs. Season each egg with salt and pepper to taste, then cover skillet and place over medium-low heat. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes for runny yolks or 6 to 7 minutes for set yolks.  
4. TO SERVE: Place tortillas on serving plates; gently scoop 1 egg onto each tortilla. Spoon salsa around each egg, covering tortillas, but leaving portion of eggs exposed. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon cilantro and serve with lime wedges.

SPANISH TORTILLA WITH ROASTED RED PEPPERS AND PEAS  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
Spanish tortillas are often served warm or at room temperature with olives, pickles, and Garlic Mayonnaise as an appetizer. They may also be served with a salad as a light entrée. For the most traditional tortilla, omit the roasted red peppers and peas.  
6 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil  
1-1⁄2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled, quartered, and cut into 1⁄8-inch-thick slices  
1 small onion, halved and sliced thin  
1 teaspoon salt  
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper  
8 large eggs  
1⁄2 cup jarred roasted red peppers, rinsed, patted dry, and cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces  
1⁄2 cup frozen peas, thawed  
GARLIC MAYONNAISE  
#instructions  
1. Toss 4 tablespoons oil, potatoes, onion, 1⁄2 teaspoon salt, and pepper in large bowl until potato slices are thoroughly separated and coated in oil. Heat 2 tablespoons more oil in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Reduce heat to medium-low, add potato mixture to skillet, and set bowl aside without washing. Cover and cook, stirring with heatproof rubber spatula every 5 minutes, until potatoes offer no resistance when poked with paring knife, 22 to 28 minutes (some potato slices may break into smaller pieces).  
2. Meanwhile, whisk eggs and remaining 1⁄2 teaspoon salt in reserved bowl until just combined. Using rubber spatula, fold hot potato mixture, red peppers, and peas into eggs until combined, making sure to scrape all of potato mixture out of skillet. Return skillet to medium-high heat, add remaining 1 teaspoon oil, and heat until just beginning to smoke. Add egg-potato mixture and cook, shaking pan and folding mixture constantly for 15 seconds. Smooth top of mixture with rubber spatula. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook, gently shaking pan every 30 seconds until bottom is golden brown and top is lightly set, about 2 minutes.  
3. Using rubber spatula, loosen tortilla from pan, shaking back and forth until tortilla slides around freely in pan. Slide tortilla onto large plate, invert onto second large plate, and slide, browned side up, back into skillet. Tuck edges of tortilla into skillet with rubber spatula. Return pan to medium heat and continue to cook, gently shaking pan every 30 seconds, until second side is golden brown, about 2 minutes longer. Slide tortilla onto cutting board or serving plate and let cool for at least 15 minutes. Cut tortilla into cubes or wedges and serve with Garlic Mayonnaise, if desired.  
SPANISH TORTILLA WITH CHORIZO AND SCALLIONS  
Use a cured, Spanish-style chorizo sausage for this recipe. Portuguese linguiça sausage is a suitable substitute.  
Omit red peppers and peas. In step 1, heat 4 ounces Spanish-style chorizo with 1 tablespoon oil in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until chorizo is browned and fat has rendered, about 5 minutes. Proceed with recipe as directed, adding potato mixture to skillet with chorizo and rendered fat and folding 4 thinly sliced scallions into eggs in step 2.

CLASSIC QUICHE LORRAINE  
#quantity  
SERVES 8  
#ingredients  
You can use Foolproof, All-Butter, or Classic Single-Crust Pie Dough (HERE) for this quiche. The center of the quiche will be surprisingly soft when it comes out of the oven, but the filling will continue to set (and sink somewhat) as it cools.  
8 slices bacon, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces  
2 large eggs plus 2 large yolks  
1 cup whole milk  
1 cup heavy cream  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt

DEEP-DISH QUICHE LORRAINE  
#quantity  
SERVES 8 TO 10  
#ingredients  
To prevent the crust from sagging during blind baking, make sure it overhangs the pan’s edge and use plenty of pie weights (3 to 4 cups). Be sure to use a cake pan with at least 2-inch-tall straight sides. To reheat the whole quiche, place it on a rimmed baking sheet on the middle rack of a 325-degree oven for 20 minutes; slices can be reheated in a 375-degree oven for 10 minutes. This recipe use a total of 9 eggs; one egg is separated and the white is used for the crust, while the yolk is used in the filling.  
CRUST  
1-3⁄4 cups (8-3⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces and chilled  
3 tablespoons sour cream  
1⁄4–1⁄3 cup ice water  
1 large egg white, lightly beaten  
CUSTARD FILLING  
8 slices thick-cut bacon, cut into 1⁄4-inch pieces  
2 onions, chopped fine  
1-1⁄2 tablespoons cornstarch  
1-1⁄2 cups whole milk  
8 large eggs plus 1 large yolk  
1-1⁄2 cups heavy cream  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper  
1⁄8 teaspoon ground nutmeg  
1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
6 ounces Gruyère cheese, shredded (1-1⁄2 cups)  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CRUST: Process flour and salt together in food processor until combined, about 3 seconds. Add butter and pulse until butter is size of large peas, about 10 pulses.  
2. Combine sour cream and 1⁄4 cup ice water in small bowl. Add half of sour cream mixture to flour mixture; pulse 3 times. Repeat with remaining sour cream mixture. Pinch dough with fingers; if dough is floury, dry, and does not hold together, add 1 to 2 tablespoons more ice water and pulse until dough forms large clumps and no dry flour remains, 3 to 5 pulses.  
3. Turn dough out onto counter and flatten into 6-inch disk; wrap disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm but not hard, 1 to 2 hours, before rolling. (Dough can be refrigerated for up to 1 day; let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes before rolling.)  
4. Cut two 16-inch lengths of aluminum foil. Arrange foil pieces, perpendicular to each other, in 9-inch round cake pan, pushing them into corners and up sides of pan; press overhang against outside of pan. Spray foil lightly with vegetable oil spray.  
5. Roll out dough on generously floured counter to 15-inch circle about 1⁄4 inch thick. Roll dough loosely around rolling pin and unroll into prepared cake pan. Working around circumference, ease dough into pan by gently lifting edge of dough with 1 hand while pressing into pan bottom with other. Trim any dough that extends more than 1 inch over edge of pan. Patch any cracks or holes with dough scraps as needed. Refrigerate any remaining dough scraps. Refrigerate dough-lined pan until dough is firm, about 30 minutes, then freeze for 20 minutes.  
6. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line dough with foil or parchment paper and fill completely with pie weights, gently pressing weights into corners of shell. Bake on rimmed baking sheet until exposed edges of dough are beginning to brown but bottom is still light in color, 30 to 40 minutes. Carefully remove foil and pie weights. If any new holes or cracks have formed in dough, patch with reserved scraps. Return shell to oven and bake until bottom is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes longer. Remove shell from oven and brush interior with egg white. Set aside while preparing filling. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.  
7. FOR THE CUSTARD FILLING: Cook bacon in 12-inch skillet over medium heat until crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to paper towel–lined plate and discard all but 2 tablespoons bacon fat from skillet. Return to medium heat, add onions, and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and lightly browned, about 12 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly.  
8. Whisk cornstarch and 3 tablespoons milk together in large bowl to dissolve cornstarch. Whisk in remaining milk, eggs, egg yolk, cream, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and cayenne until smooth.  
9. Scatter onions, bacon, and cheese evenly over crust. Gently pour custard mixture over filling. Using fork, push filling ingredients down into custard and drag gently through custard to dislodge air bubbles. Gently tap pan on counter to dislodge any remaining air bubbles.  
10. Bake until top of quiche is lightly browned, toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, and center registers 170 degrees, 1-1⁄4 to 1-1⁄2 hours. Transfer to wire rack and let stand until cool to touch, about 2 hours.  
11. When ready to serve, use sharp paring knife to remove any crust that extends beyond edge of pan. Lift foil overhang from sides of pan and remove quiche from pan; gently slide thin-bladed spatula between quiche and foil to loosen, then slide quiche onto serving plate. Cut into wedges. Serve warm or at room temperature.  
DEEP-DISH QUICHE WITH LEEKS AND BLUE CHEESE  
Sweet leeks and tangy blue cheese make perfect partners in this variation.  
Omit bacon and onions. Melt 1 tablespoon unsalted butter in 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add 4 large leeks, white and light green parts only, halved lengthwise, sliced 1⁄4 inch thick, and washed thoroughly; cook until softened, 10 to 12 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high; continue to cook, stirring constantly, until leeks are beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer leeks to plate lined with triple layer of paper towels; press with double layer of paper towels to remove excess moisture. Increase salt in filling to 1 teaspoon. Substitute 6 ounces crumbled blue cheese for Gruyère; scatter blue cheese and sautéed leeks evenly over crust before adding custard. Reduce baking time to 1 to 1-1⁄4 hours.  
DEEP-DISH QUICHE WITH SAUSAGE, BROCCOLI RABE, AND MOZZARELLA  
Be sure to use supermarket-style low-moisture mozzarella in this variation; fresh mozzarella will make for a too-wet filling.  
Omit bacon and onions. Cook 8 ounces hot or sweet Italian sausage, casings removed, in 12-inch skillet over medium heat, breaking sausage into 1⁄2-inch pieces, until no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to paper towel–lined plate and discard all but 2 tablespoons fat from skillet. Return skillet to medium heat, add 8 ounces broccoli rabe, trimmed and cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces, and cook until slightly softened, about 6 minutes. Transfer rabe to plate lined with triple layer of paper towels; press with double layer of paper towels to remove excess moisture. Increase salt in filling to 1 teaspoon. Substitute 6 ounces shredded low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella cheese for Gruyère; scatter mozzarella, cooked sausage, and broccoli rabe evenly over crust before adding custard. Reduce baking time to 1 to 1-1⁄4 hours.

Either yellow or white onions work well in this recipe, but stay away from sweet onions, such as Vidalias, which will make the tart watery. Use a 9-inch tinned-steel tart pan. This tart can be served hot or at room temperature.  
CRUST  
1-1⁄4 cups (6-1⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1 tablespoon sugar  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄2-inch cubes and chilled  
2–3 tablespoons ice water  
FILLING  
4 slices bacon, cut into 1⁄4-inch pieces  
Vegetable oil, if needed  
1-1⁄2 pounds onions, halved through root end and cut crosswise into 1⁄4-inch slices  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1 sprig fresh thyme  
2 large eggs  
1⁄2 cup half-and-half  
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CRUST: Spray 9-inch tart pan with vegetable oil spray. Pulse flour, sugar, and salt in food processor until combined, about 4 pulses. Scatter butter pieces over flour mixture; pulse until mixture resembles coarse sand, about 15 pulses. Add 2 tablespoons ice water and process until large clumps form and no powdery bits remain, about 5 seconds, adding up to 1 tablespoon more water if dough will not form clumps. Transfer dough to prepared tart pan; pat dough into pan. Lay plastic wrap over dough and smooth out any bumps or shallow areas. Place tart shell on plate and freeze for 30 minutes.  
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Place frozen tart shell on baking sheet. Spray piece of extra-wide heavy-duty aluminum foil with vegetable oil spray and gently press against dough and over edges of tart pan. Fill with pie weights and bake until top edge just starts to color and surface of dough no longer looks wet, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven and remove foil and weights. Return baking sheet with tart shell to oven and bake until golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Set baking sheet with tart shell on wire rack. Do not turn off oven.  
3. FOR THE FILLING: Meanwhile, cook bacon in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towel–lined plate. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons bacon fat from skillet (or add vegetable oil if needed to make this amount).  
4. Add onions, salt, and thyme to skillet. Cover and cook until onions release liquid and start to wilt, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue to cook, covered, until onions are very soft, about 20 minutes, stirring once or twice (if after 15 minutes onions look wet, remove lid and continue to cook another 5 minutes). Remove pan from heat and let onions cool for 5 minutes.  
5. Whisk eggs, half-and-half, and pepper together in large bowl. Remove and discard thyme sprig from onions. Stir onions into egg mixture until just incorporated. Spread onion mixture over tart shell and sprinkle bacon evenly on top.  
6. Bake tart on baking sheet until center of tart feels firm to touch, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on wire rack at least 10 minutes. Remove tart pan ring; gently slide thin-bladed spatula between pan bottom and crust to loosen, then slide tart onto serving plate. Cut into wedges and serve.

FRENCH TOAST  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
To prevent the butter from clumping during mixing, warm the milk in a microwave or small saucepan until warm to the touch (about 80 degrees). The French toast can be cooked all at once on an electric griddle, but may take an extra 2 to 3 minutes per side. Set the griddle temperature to 350 degrees and use the entire amount of butter (4 tablespoons) for cooking. Serve with warm maple syrup.  
8 large slices hearty white sandwich bread or challah  
1-1⁄2 cups whole milk, warmed  
3 large egg yolks  
3 tablespoons packed light brown sugar  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter plus 2 tablespoons melted  
1 tablespoon vanilla extract  
1⁄2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Place bread on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Bake bread until almost dry throughout (center should remain slightly moist), about 16 minutes, flipping slices halfway through baking. Remove bread from rack and let cool for 5 minutes. Return baking sheet with wire rack to oven and reduce temperature to 200 degrees.  
2. Whisk milk, egg yolks, sugar, 2 tablespoons melted butter, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt in large bowl until well blended. Transfer mixture to 13 by 9-inch baking pan.  
3. Soak bread in milk mixture until saturated but not falling apart, 20 seconds per side. Using firm slotted spatula, pick up 1 bread slice and allow excess milk mixture to drip off; repeat with remaining slices. Place soaked bread on another baking sheet or platter.  
4. Melt 1⁄2 tablespoon butter in 12-inch skillet over medium-low heat. Using slotted spatula, transfer 2 slices soaked bread to skillet and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and continue to cook until second side is golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes longer. (If toast is cooking too quickly, reduce temperature slightly.) Transfer to baking sheet in oven. Wipe out skillet with paper towels. Repeat cooking with remaining bread, 2 pieces at a time, adding 1⁄2 tablespoon of butter for each batch. Serve warm.  
EXTRA-CRISP FRENCH TOAST  
Process 1 slice hearty white sandwich bread or challah, torn into 1-inch pieces, 1 tablespoon packed light brown sugar, and 1⁄4 teaspoon ground cinnamon in food processor until finely ground, 8 to 12 pulses (you should have about 1⁄2 cup). Sprinkle 1 tablespoon bread-crumb mixture over 1 side of each slice of soaked bread. Cook as directed in step 4, starting with crumb mixture side down.  
ALMOND-CRUSTED FRENCH TOAST  
Process 1⁄2 cup slivered almonds and 1 tablespoon packed light brown sugar in food processor until coarsely ground, 12 to 15 pulses (you should have about 1⁄2 cup). Add 1 tablespoon triple sec and 1 teaspoon grated orange zest to milk mixture in step 2. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon nut mixture over 1 side of each slice of soaked bread. Cook as directed in step 4, starting with nut mixture side down.  
PECAN-RUM FRENCH TOAST  
Substitute 8 large slices cinnamon-raisin bread for hearty white sandwich bread. Process 1⁄2 cup pecans, 1 tablespoon packed light brown sugar, and 1⁄4 teaspoon ground cinnamon in food processor until coarsely ground, 12 to 15 pulses (you should have about 1⁄2 cup). Add 2 teaspoons dark rum to milk mixture in step 2. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon nut mixture over 1 side of each slice of soaked bread. Cook as directed in step 4, starting with nut mixture side down.

BEST BUTTERMILK PANCAKES  
#quantity  
MAKES SIXTEEN 4-INCH PANCAKES, SERVING 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
The pancakes can be cooked on an electric griddle. Set the griddle temperature to 350 degrees and cook as directed. The test kitchen prefers a lower-protein all-purpose flour like Gold Medal or Pillsbury for this recipe. If you use an all-purpose flour with a higher protein content, like King Arthur, you will need to add an extra tablespoon or two of buttermilk. Serve with warm maple syrup.  
2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour  
2 tablespoons sugar  
1 teaspoon baking powder  
1⁄2 teaspoon baking soda  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
2 cups buttermilk  
1⁄4 cup sour cream  
2 large eggs  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled  
1–2 teaspoons vegetable oil  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Spray wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet with vegetable oil spray; place in oven. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in medium bowl. In second medium bowl, whisk together buttermilk, sour cream, eggs, and melted butter. Make well in center of dry ingredients and pour in wet ingredients; gently stir until just combined (batter should remain lumpy, with few streaks of flour). Do not overmix. Let batter sit for 10 minutes before cooking.  
2. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Using paper towels, carefully wipe out oil, leaving thin film of oil on bottom and sides of pan. Using 1⁄4-cup measure, portion batter into pan in 4 places. Cook until edges are set, first side is golden brown, and bubbles on surface are just beginning to break, 2 to 3 minutes. Using thin, wide spatula, flip pancakes and continue to cook until second side is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Serve pancakes immediately, or transfer to wire rack in preheated oven. Repeat with remaining batter, using remaining oil as necessary.

#ingredients  
The pancakes can be cooked on an electric griddle. Set the griddle temperature to 350 degrees and cook as directed. Familia brand no-sugar-added muesli is the best choice for this recipe. If you can’t find Familia, look for Alpen or any no-sugar-added muesli. (If you can’t find muesli without sugar, muesli with sugar added will work; reduce the brown sugar in the recipe to 1 tablespoon.) Mix the batter first and then heat the pan. Letting the batter sit while the pan heats will give the dry ingredients time to absorb the wet ingredients; otherwise, the batter will be runny. Serve with maple syrup or Apple, Cranberry, and Pecan Topping.  
2 cups whole milk  
4 teaspoons fresh lemon juice  
1-1⁄4 cups (6 ounces), plus 3 tablespoons no-sugar-added muesli  
3⁄4 cup (3-3⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour

GERMAN APPLE PANCAKE  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
A 10-inch ovensafe skillet is necessary for this recipe; we highly recommend using a nonstick skillet for the sake of easy cleanup, but a regular skillet will work as well. If you prefer tart apples, use Granny Smiths; if you prefer sweet ones, use Braeburns. For serving, dust the apple pancake with confectioners’ sugar and pass warm maple syrup or Caramel Sauce separately, if desired.  
1⁄2 cup (2-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1 tablespoon granulated sugar  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
2 large eggs  
2⁄3 cup half-and-half  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1-1⁄4 pounds Granny Smith or Braeburn apples, peeled, cored, quartered, and cut into 1⁄2-inch-thick slices  
1⁄4 cup packed brown sugar  
1⁄4 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
1 teaspoon lemon juice  
Confectioners’ sugar

CARAMEL SAUCE  
#quantity  
MAKES ABOUT 1-1⁄2 CUPS  
#ingredients  
When the hot cream mixture is added in step 3, the hot sugar syrup will bubble vigorously (and dangerously), so don’t use a smaller saucepan. If you make the caramel sauce ahead, reheat it in the microwave or a small saucepan over low heat until warm and fluid.  
1⁄2 cup water  
1 cup sugar  
1 cup heavy cream  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1⁄2 teaspoon lemon juice  
#instructions  
1. Place water in 2-quart saucepan. Pour sugar in center of pan, taking care not to let sugar touch sides of pan. Cover and bring mixture to boil over high heat; once boiling, uncover and continue to boil until syrup is thick and straw-colored and registers 300 degrees, about 7 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and continue to cook until syrup is deep amber and registers 350 degrees, 1 to 2 minutes.  
2. Meanwhile, bring cream and salt to simmer in small saucepan over high heat (if cream boils before sugar reaches deep amber color, remove cream from heat and cover to keep warm).  
3. Remove sugar syrup from heat. Very carefully pour about one quarter of hot cream into syrup (mixture will bubble vigorously) and let bubbling subside. Add remaining cream, vanilla, and lemon juice; whisk until sauce is smooth. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.)

BUTTERMILK WAFFLES  
#quantity  
MAKES ABOUT EIGHT 7-INCH ROUND WAFFLES  
#ingredients  
While the waffles can be eaten as soon as they are removed from the waffle iron, they will have a crispier exterior if rested in a warm oven for 10 minutes. (This method also makes it possible to serve everyone at the same time.) Buttermilk powder is available in most supermarkets and is generally located near the dried-milk products or in the baking aisle. Leftover buttermilk powder can be kept in the refrigerator for up to a year. Seltzer or club soda gives these waffles a light texture that would otherwise be provided by whipped egg whites. (Avoid sparkling water such as Perrier—it’s not bubbly enough.) Use a freshly opened container for maximum lift. Serve waffles with butter and warm maple syrup.  
2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄2 cup dried buttermilk powder  
1 tablespoon sugar  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1⁄2 teaspoon baking soda  
1⁄2 cup sour cream  
2 large eggs  
1⁄4 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1⁄4 cup vegetable oil  
1-1⁄4 cups seltzer water  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet; place in oven. Whisk flour, buttermilk powder, sugar, salt, and baking soda together in large bowl. Whisk sour cream, eggs, vanilla, and oil together in medium bowl to combine. Gently stir seltzer into wet ingredients. Make well in center of dry ingredients and pour in wet ingredients. Using a rubber spatula, gently stir until just combined (batter should remain lumpy with few streaks of flour).  
2. Heat waffle iron and bake waffles according to manufacturer’s instructions (use about 1⁄3 cup for 7-inch round iron). Transfer waffles to wire rack in preheated oven; repeat with remaining batter. Serve.

#ingredients  
While the waffles can be eaten as soon as they are removed from the waffle iron, they will have a crispier exterior if rested in a warm oven for 10 minutes. (This method also makes it possible to serve everyone at the same time.) This batter must be made 12 to 24 hours in advance. We prefer the texture of the waffles made in a classic waffle iron, but a Belgian waffle iron will work, though it will make fewer waffles.  
1-3⁄4 cups milk  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces  
2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1 tablespoon sugar  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast  
1 teaspoon salt  
2 large eggs  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
#instructions  
1. Heat milk and butter in small saucepan over medium-low heat until butter is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Let mixture cool until warm to touch.  
2. Meanwhile, whisk flour, sugar, yeast, and salt together in large bowl. Gradually whisk warm milk mixture into flour mixture; continue to whisk until batter is smooth. Whisk eggs and vanilla together in small bowl until combined, then add egg mixture to batter and whisk until incorporated. Scrape down bowl with rubber spatula, cover bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 12 or up to 24 hours.  
3. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet; place in oven. Heat waffle iron according to manufacturer’s instructions. Remove batter from refrigerator when waffle iron is hot (batter will be foamy and doubled in size). Whisk batter to recombine (batter will deflate). Bake waffles according to manufacturer’s instructions (use about 1⁄2 cup for 7-inch round iron and about 1 cup for 9-inch square iron). Transfer waffles to wire rack in preheated oven; repeat with remaining batter. Serve.

FLAKY BUTTERMILK BISCUITS  
#quantity  
MAKES 12 BISCUITS  
#ingredients  
The dough is a bit sticky when it comes together and during the first set of turns. Note that you will use up to 1 cup of flour for dusting the work surface, dough, and rolling pin to prevent sticking. Be careful not to incorporate large pockets of flour into the dough when folding it over. When cutting the biscuits, press down with firm, even pressure; do not twist the cutter.  
2-1⁄2 cups (12-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1 tablespoon baking powder  
1⁄2 teaspoon baking soda  
1 teaspoon salt  
2 tablespoons vegetable shortening, cut into 1⁄2-inch chunks  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled, lightly floured, and cut into 1⁄8-inch slices plus 2 tablespoons melted and cooled  
1-1⁄4 cups buttermilk, chilled  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in large bowl.  
2. Add shortening to flour mixture; break up chunks with fingertips until only small, pea-size pieces remain. Working with a few butter slices at a time, drop butter slices into flour mixture and toss to coat. Pick up each slice of butter and press between well-floured fingertips into flat, nickel-size pieces. Repeat until all butter is incorporated, then toss to combine. Freeze mixture (in bowl) until chilled, about 15 minutes, or refrigerate for about 30 minutes.  
3. Spray 24-inch-square area of counter with vegetable oil spray; spread spray evenly across surface with clean kitchen towel or paper towel. Sprinkle 1⁄3 cup flour across sprayed area, then gently spread flour across work surface with palm to form thin, even coating. Add 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons buttermilk to flour mixture. Stir briskly with fork until ball forms and no dry bits of flour are visible, adding remaining 2 tablespoons buttermilk as needed (dough will be sticky and shaggy but should clear sides of bowl). With rubber spatula, transfer dough onto center of prepared counter, dust surface lightly with flour, and, with floured hands, bring dough together into cohesive ball.  
4. Pat dough into approximate 10-inch square, then roll into 18 by 14-inch rectangle about 1⁄4 inch thick, dusting dough and rolling pin with flour as needed. Use bench scraper or thin metal spatula to fold dough into thirds, brushing any excess flour from surface of dough. Lift short end of dough and fold in thirds again to form approximate 6 by 4-inch rectangle. Rotate dough 90 degrees, dusting counter underneath with flour, then roll and fold dough again, dusting with flour as needed.  
5. Roll dough into 10-inch square about 1⁄2 inch thick. Flip dough over and cut nine 3-inch rounds with floured 3-inch biscuit cutter, dipping cutter back into flour after each cut. Carefully invert and transfer rounds to ungreased baking sheet, spacing them 1 inch apart. Gather dough scraps into ball and roll and fold once or twice until scraps form smooth dough. Roll dough into 1⁄2-inch-thick round and cut 3 more 3-inch rounds and transfer to baking sheet. Discard excess dough.  
6. Brush biscuit tops with melted butter. Bake, without opening oven door, until tops are golden brown and crisp, 15 to 17 minutes. Let cool on baking sheet for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

BLUEBERRY SCONES  
#quantity  
MAKES 8 SCONES  
#ingredients  
It is important to work the dough as little as possible—work quickly and knead and fold the dough only the number of times called for or else the scones will turn out tough, rather than tender. The butter should be frozen solid before grating. In hot or humid environments, chill the flour mixture and mixing bowls before use. While this recipe calls for 2 whole sticks of butter, only 10 tablespoons are actually used (see step 1). If fresh berries are unavailable, an equal amount of frozen berries, not thawed, can be substituted. An equal amount of raspberries, blackberries, or strawberries can be used in place of the blueberries. Cut larger berries into 1⁄4- to 1⁄2-inch pieces before incorporating. Serve with Homemade Clotted Cream, if desired.  
16 tablespoons unsalted butter (2 sticks), each stick frozen  
7-1⁄2 ounces (1-1⁄2 cups) blueberries  
1⁄2 cup whole milk  
1⁄2 cup sour cream  
2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄2 cup (3-1⁄2 ounces) plus 1 tablespoon sugar  
2 teaspoons baking powder  
1⁄4 teaspoon baking soda  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove half of wrapper from each stick of frozen butter. Grate unwrapped ends (half of each stick) on large holes of box grater (you should grate total of 8 tablespoons). Place grated butter in freezer until needed. Melt 2 tablespoons of remaining ungrated butter and set aside. Save remaining 6 tablespoons butter for another use. Place blueberries in freezer until needed.  
2. Whisk milk and sour cream together in medium bowl; refrigerate until needed. Whisk flour, 1⁄2 cup sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and lemon zest in medium bowl. Add frozen grated butter to flour mixture and toss with fingers until butter is thoroughly coated.  
3. Add milk mixture to flour mixture and fold with rubber spatula until just combined. Using spatula, transfer dough to liberally floured counter. Dust surface of dough with flour and with floured hands, knead dough 6 to 8 times, until it just holds together in ragged ball, adding flour as needed to prevent sticking.  
4. Roll dough into approximate 12-inch square. Fold dough into thirds like a business letter, using bench scraper or metal spatula to release dough if it sticks to counter. Lift short ends of dough and fold into thirds again to form approximate 4-inch square. Transfer dough to plate lightly dusted with flour and chill in freezer 5 minutes.  
5. Transfer dough to floured counter and roll into approximate 12-inch square again. Sprinkle blueberries evenly over surface of dough, then press down so they are slightly embedded in dough. Using bench scraper or thin metal spatula, loosen dough from counter. Roll dough into cylinder, pressing to form tight log. Arrange log seam side down and press into 12 by 4-inch rectangle. Using sharp, floured knife, cut rectangle crosswise into 4 equal rectangles. Cut each rectangle diagonally to form 2 triangles and transfer to prepared baking sheet.  
6. Brush tops with melted butter and sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake until tops and bottoms are golden brown, 18 to 25 minutes. Transfer to wire rack and let cool for at least 10 minutes before serving.  
TO MAKE AHEAD: After placing scones on baking sheet in step 5, either refrigerate them overnight or freeze for up to 1 month. When ready to bake, for refrigerated scones, heat oven to 425 degrees and follow directions in step 6. For frozen scones, do not thaw, heat oven to 375 degrees and follow directions in step 6, extending cooking time to 25 to 30 minutes.

OLD-FASHIONED BLUEBERRY MUFFINS  
#quantity  
MAKES 12 MUFFINS  
#ingredients  
This recipe does not require a stand mixer, but when making the batter, be sure to whisk vigorously in step 2, then fold carefully in step 3. There should be no large pockets of flour in the finished batter, but small occasional spots may remain. Do not overmix the batter. These muffins are great unadorned, but for an extra flourish, dip warm muffins in melted butter, then in mixture of 1⁄2 cup granulated sugar and two teaspoons cinnamon.  
2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1 tablespoon baking powder  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
1 large egg  
1 cup (7 ounces) sugar  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled  
1-1⁄4 cups sour cream  
6 ounces (1-1⁄2 cups) frozen blueberries, preferably wild  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Spray 12-cup muffin tin with vegetable oil spray.  
2. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in medium bowl until combined. Whisk egg in second medium bowl until well-combined and light-colored, about 20 seconds. Add sugar and whisk vigorously until thick and homogeneous, about 30 seconds. Add melted butter in 2 or 3 steps, whisking to combine after each addition. Add sour cream in 2 steps, whisking until just combined.  
3. Add blueberries to dry ingredients and gently toss to combine. Add sour cream mixture and carefully fold with rubber spatula until batter comes together and berries are evenly distributed, 25 to 30 seconds (small spots of flour may remain and batter will be thick). Do not overmix.  
4. Using ice cream scoop or large spoon, divide batter evenly among prepared muffin cups. Bake until muffins are golden brown and toothpick inserted in center of muffin comes out with few crumbs attached, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating muffing tin halfway through baking. Invert muffins onto wire rack, stand muffins upright, and let cool for 5 minutes. Serve.  
LEMON-GLAZED OR GINGER-GLAZED BLUEBERRY MUFFINS  
While muffins are baking, mix 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest or grated fresh ginger and 1⁄2 cup sugar in small bowl and set aside. Bring 1⁄4 cup lemon juice and 1⁄4 cup sugar to simmer in small saucepan over medium heat and simmer until mixture is thick and syrupy and reduced to about 4 tablespoons. After muffins have cooled for 5 minutes, brush tops with glaze, then, working one at a time, dip tops in lemon-sugar or ginger-sugar. Set muffins upright on wire rack and serve.

POPOVERS  
#quantity  
MAKES 6  
#ingredients  
High heat is crucial to the speedy, high rise of popovers. When it’s time to fill the preheated popover pan with batter, get the pan out of and back into the oven as quickly as possible, making sure to close the oven door while you pour the batter into the pan. Popovers made in a muffin tin won’t rise nearly as high as those made in a popover pan, but they still taste quite good .  
2 large eggs  
1 cup whole milk  
1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted and cooled  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
#instructions  
1. Process eggs and milk together in blender until smooth. Add flour, melted butter, and salt and continue to process on high speed until batter is bubbly and smooth, about 1 minute. Cover and let batter rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.  
2. While batter is resting, measure 1⁄2 teaspoon oil into each cup of popover pan. Adjust oven rack to lowest position, place popover pan in oven, and heat oven to 450 degrees.  
3. After batter has rested, pour it into 4-cup liquid measuring cup or another container with a spout (you should have about 2 cups batter). Working quickly, remove pan from oven and divide batter evenly among 6 cups in pan. Return pan to oven and bake for 20 minutes (do not open oven door).  
4. Lower heat to 350 degrees and continue to bake until popovers are golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes longer. Gently flip popovers out onto wire rack and let cool slightly before serving.  
MUFFIN TIN POPOVERS  
Increase oil to 5 teaspoons. Use 12-cup muffin tin in place of popover pan and grease only 10 outer cups of tin. In step 3, divide batter evenly among outer 10 muffin cups.

BUTTERMILK DOUGHNUTS  
#quantity  
MAKES 15 TO 17 DOUGHNUTS  
#ingredients  
For a chewier doughnut with a less crisp exterior, add 1⁄4 cup of flour. The dough can be made by hand, using a large bowl with a wooden spoon, or in a mixer as directed. Doughnuts rolled from scraps will be a little drier and less crisp than those cut from the first roll. You will need at least a 6-quart Dutch oven for this recipe. These doughnuts are best eaten very warm, as soon out of the pot as possible.  
3-1⁄2 cups (17-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1 cup sugar  
1⁄2 teaspoon baking soda  
2 teaspoons baking powder  
1 teaspoon salt  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons ground nutmeg  
3⁄4 cup buttermilk  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled  
2 large eggs plus 1 large yolk  
6 cups vegetable shortening  
#instructions  
1. Line baking sheet or wire rack with paper towels. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, mix 1 cup flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg on low speed to combine.  
2. Mix buttermilk, butter, eggs, and egg yolk in liquid measuring cup. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and beat on medium speed until smooth, about 30 seconds. Decrease speed to low, gradually add remaining 2-1⁄2 cups flour, and mix until just combined, about 30 seconds. Stir batter once or twice with wooden spoon or rubber spatula to ensure all liquid is incorporated. (Dough will be moist and tacky, a cross between cake batter and cookie dough.)  
3. Heat shortening in Dutch oven over medium-high heat to 375 degrees. Meanwhile, turn dough out onto lightly floured counter. Roll out dough with heavily floured rolling pin to 1⁄2-inch thickness. Cut out dough rings with heavily floured doughnut cutter, reflouring between cuts. Transfer dough rounds to baking sheet or large wire rack. Gather scraps and gently press into disk; repeat rolling and stamping process until all dough is used. (Cut doughnuts can be covered and stored at room temperature for up to 2 hours.)  
4. Carefully drop dough rings, 4 or 5 at a time, into hot fat. Turn doughnuts as they rise to surface with tongs, wire skimmer, or slotted spoon, frying doughnuts until golden brown, about 50 seconds per side. Drain on prepared baking sheet or wire rack. Repeat frying, returning fat to temperature between each batch. Serve.  
SUGARED BUTTERMILK DOUGHNUTS  
Regular confectioners’ sugar breaks down into a gummy glaze on the doughnuts, but Snow White Non-Melting Sugar makes a long-lasting coating.  
Let fried doughnuts cool about 1 minute, then toss in 1 cup nonmelting sugar to coat.  
CINNAMON-SUGARED BUTTERMILK DOUGHNUTS  
Mix 1 cup sugar with 1-1⁄2 tablespoons cinnamon in small bowl. Let fried doughnuts cool about 1 minute, then toss in cinnamon sugar to coat.

2. FOR THE FILLING: Combine brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, cloves, and salt in small bowl. Add melted butter and stir with fork or fingers until mixture resembles wet sand; set aside.  
3. FOR THE DOUGH: Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in large bowl. Whisk buttermilk and 2 tablespoons melted butter in measuring cup or small bowl. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir with wooden spoon until liquid is absorbed (dough will look very shaggy), about 30 seconds. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and knead until just smooth and no longer shaggy.  
4. Pat dough with hands into 12 by 9-inch rectangle. Brush dough with 2 tablespoons melted butter, then sprinkle evenly with filling, leaving 1⁄2-inch border around edges and press filling firmly into dough to adhere. Using bench scraper or metal spatula, loosen dough from counter. Starting at long side, roll dough, pressing lightly, to form tight cylinder. Pinch seam to seal. Arrange cylinder seam side down and cut into 8 equal pieces. With hand, slightly flatten each piece of dough to seal open edges and keep filling in place. Place 1 roll in center of prepared pan, then place remaining 7 rolls around perimeter of pan. Brush with remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter.  
5. Bake until edges are golden brown, 23 to 25 minutes. Using offset metal spatula, loosen buns from pan; without separating, slide buns out of pan onto prepared wire rack. Let cool about 5 minutes before icing.  
6. FOR THE ICING: While buns are cooling, line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and set rack with buns over baking sheet. Whisk cream cheese and buttermilk together in large bowl until thick and smooth (mixture will look like cottage cheese at first). Sift sugar over and whisk until smooth glaze forms, about 30 seconds. Spoon glaze evenly over buns; serve immediately.

NEW YORK–STYLE CRUMB CAKE  
#quantity  
SERVES 8 TO 10  
#ingredients  
Don’t be tempted to substitute all-purpose flour for the cake flour, as doing so will make a dry, tough cake. If you can’t find buttermilk, you can substitute an equal amount of plain low-fat yogurt. When topping the cake, take care to not push the crumbs into the batter. This recipe can be easily doubled and baked in a 13 by 9-inch baking dish. If doubling, increase the baking time to about 45 minutes.  
CRUMB TOPPING  
1⁄3 cup (2-1⁄3 ounces) granulated sugar  
1⁄3 cup packed (2-1⁄3 ounces) dark brown sugar  
3⁄4 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and warm  
1-3⁄4 cups (7 ounces) cake flour

#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Cut 16-inch length parchment paper or aluminum foil and fold lengthwise to 7-inch width. Spray 8-inch square baking dish with vegetable oil spray and fit parchment/foil into dish, pushing it into corners and up sides, allowing excess to hang over edges of dish.  
2. FOR THE TOPPING: Whisk granulated sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and butter together in medium bowl to combine. Add flour and stir with rubber spatula or wooden spoon until mixture resembles thick, cohesive dough; set aside to cool to room temperature, 10 to 15 minutes.  
3. FOR THE CAKE: Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, mix flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt on low speed to combine. With mixer running, add butter 1 piece at a time. Continue beating until mixture resembles moist crumbs, with no visible butter chunks remaining, 1 to 2 minutes. Add whole egg, egg yolk, vanilla, and buttermilk and beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 1 minute, scraping down bowl as needed.  
4. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Using rubber spatula, spread batter into even layer. Break apart crumb topping into large pea-size pieces and spread in even layer over batter, beginning with edges and then working toward center. Bake until crumbs are golden and toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool on wire rack at least 30 minutes. Remove cake from pan by lifting parchment overhang.

Firmly tap pan on counter 2 or 3 times to dislodge any bubbles. Sprinkle sugar topping evenly over batter and gently press into batter to adhere.  
4. Bake until top is golden and just firm, and skewer inserted in cake comes out clean (skewer will be wet if inserted in cream cheese filling), 45 to 50 minutes. Remove pan from oven and firmly tap on counter 2 or 3 times (top of cake may sink slightly). Let cake cool in pan on wire rack for 1 hour. Gently invert cake onto rimmed baking sheet (cake will be topping side down); remove tube pan, place wire rack on top of cake, and invert cake sugar side up. Let cool to room temperature, about 1-1⁄2 hours, before serving.

SOUR CREAM COFFEE CAKE WITH BROWN SUGAR–PECAN STREUSEL  
#quantity  
SERVES 12 TO 16  
#ingredients  
A fixed-bottom, 10-inch tube pan (with 10-cup capacity) is best for this recipe. Note that the streusel is divided into two parts—one for the inner swirls, one for the topping.  
STREUSEL  
3⁄4 cup (3-3⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour  
3⁄4 cup (5-1⁄4 ounces) granulated sugar  
1⁄2 cup packed (3-1⁄2 ounces) dark brown sugar  
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 2 pieces and chilled  
1 cup pecans, chopped  
CAKE  
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄2-inch cubes and softened but still cool  
4 large eggs  
1-1⁄2 cups sour cream  
1 tablespoon vanilla extract  
2-1⁄4 cups (11-1⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1-1⁄4 cups (8-3⁄4 ounces) granulated sugar  
1 tablespoon baking powder  
3⁄4 teaspoon baking soda  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE STREUSEL: Process flour, granulated sugar, 1⁄4 cup brown sugar, and cinnamon in food processor until combined, about 15 seconds. Transfer 1-1⁄4 cups of flour-sugar mixture to small bowl and stir in remaining 1⁄4 cup brown sugar; set aside for streusel filling. Add butter and pecans to mixture in food processor and pulse until nuts and butter resemble small pebbly pieces, about 10 pulses. Set aside for streusel topping.  
2. FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour 10-inch tube pan softened butter. Whisk eggs, 1 cup sour cream, and vanilla in medium bowl until combined.  
3. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt on low speed for 30 seconds to combine. Add butter and remaining 1⁄2 cup sour cream and mix until dry ingredients are moistened and mixture resembles wet sand, with few large butter pieces remaining, about 1-1⁄2 minutes. Increase speed to medium and beat until batter comes together, about 10 seconds; scrape down sides of bowl with rubber spatula. Lower speed to medium-low and gradually add egg mixture in 3 additions, beating for 20 seconds after each and scraping down sides of bowl. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until batter is light and fluffy, about 1 minute.  
4. Using rubber spatula, spread 2 cups batter in bottom of prepared pan and smooth surface. Sprinkle evenly with 3⁄4 cup streusel filling. Repeat with another 2 cups batter and remaining 3⁄4 cup streusel filling. Spread remaining batter over filling, then sprinkle with streusel topping.  
5. Bake until cake feels firm to touch and skewer inserted in center comes out clean (bits of sugar from streusel may cling to skewer), 50 to 60 minutes. Let cake cool in pan on wire rack for 30 minutes. Gently invert cake onto rimmed baking sheet (cake will be streusel side down); remove tube pan, place wire rack on top of cake, and invert cake streusel side up. Let cool to room temperature, about 2 hours, before serving.  
SOUR CREAM COFFEE CAKE WITH CHOCOLATE CHIPS  
Sprinkle 1⁄2 cup chocolate chips over bottom layer of batter before sprinkling with streusel and another 1⁄2 cup chocolate chips over middle layer of batter before sprinkling with streusel.  
LEMON-BLUEBERRY SOUR CREAM COFFEE CAKE  
Toss 4 ounces frozen blueberries with 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest in small bowl. Sprinkle 1⁄2 cup blueberries over bottom layer of batter before sprinkling with streusel and remaining 1⁄2 cup blueberries over middle layer of batter before sprinkling with streusel.  
APRICOT-ALMOND SOUR CREAM COFFEE CAKE  
Substitute 1 cup slivered almonds for pecans in streusel and 1⁄2 teaspoon almond extract for vanilla extract in batter. Spoon six 2-teaspoon mounds apricot jam over bottom layer of batter before sprinkling with streusel and another six 2-teaspoon mounds jam over middle layer of batter before sprinkling with streusel.

ULTIMATE BANANA BREAD  
#quantity  
SERVES 10  
#ingredients  
Be sure to use very ripe, heavily speckled (or even black) bananas in this recipe. This recipe can be made using 5 thawed frozen bananas; since they release a lot of liquid naturally, they can bypass the microwaving in step 2 and go directly into the fine-mesh strainer. Do not use a thawed frozen banana in step 4; it will be too soft to slice. Instead, simply sprinkle the top of the loaf with sugar. We developed this recipe using a loaf pan that measures 8-1⁄2 by 4-1⁄2 inches; if you use a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan, start checking for doneness 5 minutes earlier than advised in the recipe. The texture is best when the loaf is eaten fresh, but it can be stored (let cool completely first), covered tightly with plastic wrap, for up to 3 days.  
1-3⁄4 cups (8-3⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1 teaspoon baking soda  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
6 large very ripe bananas (2-1⁄4 pounds), peeled  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled  
2 large eggs  
3⁄4 cup packed (5-1⁄4 ounces) light brown sugar  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1⁄2 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped coarse (optional)  
2 teaspoons granulated sugar  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Spray 8-1⁄2 by 4-1⁄2-inch loaf pan with vegetable oil spray. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt together in large bowl.  
2. Place 5 bananas in separate bowl, cover, and microwave until bananas are soft and have released liquid, about 5 minutes. Transfer bananas to fine-mesh strainer over medium bowl and allow to drain, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes (you should have 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 cup liquid).  
3. Transfer liquid to medium saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until reduced to 1⁄4 cup, about 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat, stir reduced liquid into bananas, and mash with potato masher until mostly smooth. Whisk in butter, eggs, brown sugar, and vanilla.  
4. Pour banana mixture into dry ingredients and stir until just combined, with some streaks of flour remaining. Gently fold in walnuts, if using. Scrape batter into prepared pan. Slice remaining banana diagonally into 1⁄4-inch-thick slices. Shingle banana slices on top of loaf in 2 rows, leaving 1-1⁄2-inch-wide space down center to ensure even rise. Sprinkle granulated sugar evenly over loaf.  
5. Bake until toothpick inserted in center of loaf comes out clean, 55 to 75 minutes. Let loaf cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto wire rack and let cool for 1 hour before serving.  
SHINGLING THE LOAF  
Layering thin banana slices on either side of the loaf adds even more banana flavor to our bread (and brings the total number of bananas in the recipe to six). To ensure an even rise, leave a 1-1⁄2-inch-wide space down the center.

CRANBERRY NUT BREAD  
#quantity  
SERVES 10  
#ingredients  
Fresh or frozen cranberries (not thawed) will work here. We prefer sweet, mild pecans in this bread, but walnuts can be substituted. Resist the urge to cut into the bread while it is hot out of the oven; the texture improves as it cools, making it easier to slice. To toast pecans, heat griddle over medium heat. Add pecans, chopped coarse; toast, shaking pan frequently, until nuts are fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. We developed this recipe using a loaf pan that measures 8-1⁄2 by 4-1⁄2 inches; if you use a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan, start checking for doneness 5 minutes earlier than advised in the recipe.  
1 tablespoon grated orange zest plus 1⁄3 cup juice  
2⁄3 cup buttermilk  
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled  
1 large egg, lightly beaten  
2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1 cup (7 ounces) sugar  
1 teaspoon salt  
1 teaspoon baking powder  
1⁄4 teaspoon baking soda  
5-1⁄4 ounces (1-1⁄2 cups) fresh or frozen cranberries, chopped coarse  
1⁄2 cup pecans, toasted and chopped coarse  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease bottom of 8-1⁄2 by 4-1⁄2-inch loaf pan. Stir together orange zest, orange juice, buttermilk, butter, and egg in small bowl. Whisk together flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in second large bowl. Stir liquid ingredients into dry ingredients with rubber spatula until just moistened. Gently stir in cranberries and pecans (do not overmix).  
2. Scrape batter into loaf pan and spread with rubber spatula into corners of pan. Bake until golden brown and toothpick inserted in center of loaf comes out clean, 55 to 75 minutes. Let loaf cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto wire rack and let cool at least 1 hour before serving.

DATE-NUT BREAD  
#quantity  
SERVES 10  
#ingredients  
To make chopping the dates easier, coat the blade of your knife with a thin film of vegetable oil spray. Soaking the dates in boiling water and baking soda helps to soften their tough skins. For an accurate measurement of boiling water, bring a full kettle of water to a boil, then measure out the desired amount. The test kitchen’s preferred loaf pan measures 8-1⁄2 by 4-1⁄2 inches; if you use a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan, start checking for doneness 5 minutes earlier than advised in the recipe.  
10 ounces (1-2⁄3 cups) pitted dates, chopped coarse  
1 cup boiling water  
1 teaspoon baking soda  
2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1 teaspoon baking powder  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
3⁄4 cup packed (5-1⁄4 ounces) dark brown sugar  
2⁄3 cup buttermilk  
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled  
1 large egg  
1 cup pecans or walnuts, toasted and chopped coarse  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease 8-1⁄2 by 4-1⁄2-inch loaf pan.  
2. Stir dates, water, and baking soda together in medium bowl. Cover and set aside until dates have softened, about 30 minutes.  
3. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in large bowl. In medium bowl, whisk brown sugar, buttermilk, melted butter, and egg together until smooth, then stir in date mixture until combined. Gently fold buttermilk mixture into flour mixture with rubber spatula until just combined (do not overmix). Gently fold in pecans.  
4. Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth top. Bake until golden brown and toothpick inserted in center of loaf comes out with few crumbs attached, 55 to 60 minutes, rotating loaf pan halfway through baking.

ZUCCHINI BREAD  
#quantity  
SERVES 10  
#ingredients  
Small zucchini have smaller, drier seeds than large zucchini and are preferred in this recipe. If you are using a large zucchini, cut each zucchini in half lengthwise and use a spoon to scrape out and discard the seeds before shredding. The test kitchen’s preferred loaf pan measures 8-1⁄2 by 4-1⁄2 inches; if you use a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan, start checking for doneness 5 minutes earlier than advised in the recipe.  
2 small zucchini (1 pound), trimmed  
2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1 teaspoon baking soda  
1 teaspoon baking powder  
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
1 teaspoon ground allspice  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
1-1⁄2 cups (10-1⁄2 ounces) sugar  
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled  
2 large eggs  
1⁄4 cup plain whole-milk or low-fat yogurt  
1 tablespoon lemon juice  
1⁄2 cup pecans or walnuts, toasted and chopped coarse  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease 8-1⁄2 by 4-1⁄2-inch loaf pan. Shred zucchini using large holes of box grater. Squeeze shredded zucchini between several layers of paper towels to absorb excess moisture.

ALL-PURPOSE CORNBREAD  
#quantity  
SERVES 6  
#ingredients  
Before preparing the baking dish or any of the other ingredients, measure out the frozen kernels and let them stand at room temperature until needed. When corn is in season, fresh cooked kernels can be substituted for the frozen corn. This recipe was developed with Quaker yellow cornmeal; a stone-ground whole grain cornmeal will work but will yield a drier and less tender cornbread. We prefer a Pyrex glass baking dish because it yields a nice golden brown crust, but a metal baking pan (nonstick or traditional) will also work. Serve with a flavored butter (recipes follow).  
1-1⁄2 cups (7-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1 cup (5 ounces) cornmeal  
2 teaspoons baking powder  
1⁄4 teaspoon baking soda  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1⁄4 cup packed (1-3⁄4 ounces) light brown sugar  
3⁄4 cup frozen corn, thawed  
1 cup buttermilk  
2 large eggs  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Spray 8-inch square baking dish with vegetable oil spray. Whisk flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl until combined; set aside.  
2. In food processor or blender, process brown sugar, corn kernels, and buttermilk until combined, about 5 seconds. Add eggs and process until well combined (corn lumps will remain), about 5 seconds longer.  
3. Using rubber spatula, make well in center of dry ingredients; pour wet ingredients into well. Begin folding dry ingredients into wet, giving mixture only a few turns to barely combine. Add melted butter and continue folding until dry ingredients are just moistened. Pour batter into prepared baking dish and smooth surface with rubber spatula.  
4. Bake until cornbread is deep golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes. Let cool on wire rack for 10 minutes, then invert onto wire rack, and turn right side up and let cool until warm, about 10 minutes longer, and serve. (Leftover cornbread can be wrapped in aluminum foil and reheated in a 350-degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes.)  
SPICY JALAPEÑO-CHEDDAR CORNBREAD  
Reduce salt to 1⁄2 teaspoon. Add 3⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1 jalapeño chile, stemmed, seeded, and chopped fine, and 2 ounces shredded cheddar cheese to flour mixture and toss well to combine. Reduce brown sugar to 2 tablespoons and sprinkle 2 ounces shredded cheddar cheese over batter in dish just before baking.  
BLUEBERRY BREAKFAST CORNBREAD  
Reduce salt to 1⁄2 teaspoon. Reduce buttermilk to 3⁄4 cup and add 1⁄4 cup maple syrup to food processor along with buttermilk in step 2. Add 5 ounces fresh or 4 ounces (1 cup) frozen blueberries with melted butter in step 3. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons granulated sugar over batter in baking dish just before baking.  
MOLASSES-PECAN BUTTER  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened  
1⁄4 cup pecans, toasted and chopped fine  
4 teaspoons light molasses  
2 teaspoons sugar  
1⁄4 teaspoon vanilla extract  
Pinch salt  
Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip butter on medium speed until smooth, about 30 seconds. Add pecans, molasses, sugar, vanilla, and salt and whip until combined, about 15 seconds, then increase speed to high and whip until very light and fluffy, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed.  
SWEET ORANGE BUTTER  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened  
2 teaspoons sugar  
1 teaspoon grated orange zest  
1⁄8 teaspoon vanilla extract  
Pinch salt  
Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip butter on medium speed until smooth, about 30 seconds. Add sugar, orange zest, vanilla, and salt and whip until combined, about 15 seconds, then increase speed to high and whip until very light and fluffy, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed.  
WHIPPED HONEY BUTTER  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature  
1 tablespoon honey  
Pinch salt  
Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip butter on medium speed until smooth, about 30 seconds. Add honey and salt and whip until combined, about 15 seconds, then increase speed to high and whip until very light and fluffy, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed.

#ingredients  
Cornmeal mush of just the right texture is essential to this bread. Make sure that the water is at a rapid boil when it is added to the cornmeal. And for an accurate measurement of boiling water, bring a kettle of water to a boil, then measure out the desired amount. Though we prefer to make cornbread in a preheated cast-iron skillet, a 9-inch round cake pan or 9-inch square baking pan, greased lightly with butter and not preheated, will also produce acceptable results if you double the recipe and bake the bread for 25 minutes.  
4 teaspoons bacon drippings or 1 tablespoon melted unsalted butter plus 1 teaspoon vegetable oil  
1 cup (5 ounces) stone-ground cornmeal  
2 teaspoons granulated sugar  
1 teaspoon baking powder  
1⁄4 teaspoon baking soda  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
1⁄3 cup boiling water  
3⁄4 cup buttermilk  
1 large egg, lightly beaten  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Add bacon drippings to 8-inch cast-iron skillet and place skillet in preheating oven.  
2. Place 1⁄3 cup cornmeal in medium bowl and set aside. Mix remaining 2⁄3 cup cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in small bowl; set aside.  
3. Pour boiling water over reserved 1⁄3 cup cornmeal and stir to make stiff mush. Gradually whisk in buttermilk, breaking up lumps until smooth. Whisk in egg. When oven is up to temperature and skillet very hot, stir dry ingredients into mush mixture until just moistened. Carefully remove skillet from oven. Pour hot bacon fat from skillet into batter and stir to incorporate, then quickly pour batter into heated skillet. Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and immediately turn cornbread onto wire rack; let cool for 5 minutes, then serve.

MAKES ABOUT 12 CORN STICKS  
#ingredients  
Corn stick pans have anywhere from 7 to 12 molds. If your pan has fewer than 12 molds, you will need to bake the sticks in two batches.  
Substitute heavy-gauge corn stick pan for cast-iron skillet; heat pan in oven as directed, omitting fat. Remove hot pan from oven, brush molds generously with bacon fat, then fill almost to rim with batter. Bake until cornbread is golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Turn sticks onto rack to cool. If making second batch, wipe crumbs from molds and reheat pan in oven for 5 minutes before brushing with additional fat and filling with remaining batter.  
SOUTHERN-STYLE CORNBREAD FOR NORTHERN TASTES  
The addition of extra sugar and cake flour moves this cornbread a small step away from its Southern roots. Though still very far removed from Northern-style cornbread, this version has a subtle sweetness and a very fine texture.  
Increase sugar to 3 tablespoons and add 1⁄4 cup cake flour to dry ingredients.

CLASSIC IRISH SODA BREAD  
#quantity  
SERVES 8 TO 10  
#ingredients  
If you do not have a cast-iron skillet, the bread can be baked on a baking sheet, although the crust won’t be quite as crunchy. Soda bread is best eaten on the day it is baked but does keep well covered and stored at room temperature for a couple of days, after which time it will become dry.  
3 cups (15 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1 cup (4 ounces) cake flour  
2 tablespoons sugar  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons baking soda  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons cream of tartar  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons salt  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, plus 1 tablespoon melted for brushing loaf  
1-3⁄4 cups buttermilk  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Whisk all-purpose flour, cake flour, sugar, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt together in large bowl. Add softened butter and use fingers to rub it into flour until completely incorporated. Make well in center of flour mixture and add 1-1⁄2 cups buttermilk. Work buttermilk into flour mixture using fork until dough comes together in large clumps and there is no dry flour in bottom of bowl, adding up to 1⁄4 cup more buttermilk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until all loose flour is just moistened. Turn dough onto lightly floured counter and pat together to form 6-inch round; dough will be scrappy and uneven.  
2. Place dough in 12-inch cast-iron skillet. Score deep cross, about 5 inches long and 3⁄4 inch deep, on top of loaf and place in oven. Bake until nicely browned and knife inserted in center of loaf comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven and brush with melted butter. Let cool at least 30 minutes before serving.  
WHOLE WHEAT SODA BREAD  
This variation is known as brown bread in Ireland. The dough will be sticky and you may need to add a small amount of flour as you mix it.  
Reduce all-purpose flour to 1-1⁄2 cups and cake flour to 1⁄2 cup and increase sugar to 3 tablespoons. Add 1-1⁄2 cups whole wheat flour and 1⁄2 cup toasted wheat germ to dry ingredients.

QUICK CHEESE BREAD  
#quantity  
SERVES 10  
#ingredients  
A mild Asiago, crumbled into 1⁄4- to 1⁄2-inch pieces, can be used instead of the cheddar. Aged Asiago that is as firm as Parmesan is too sharp and piquant. If, when testing the bread for doneness, the toothpick comes out with what looks like uncooked batter clinging to it, try again in a different, but still central, spot; if the toothpick hits a pocket of cheese, it may give a false indication. The texture of the bread improves as it cools, so resist the urge to slice the loaf while it is piping hot. This cheese bread is best made with whole milk, but it will taste fine if you have only 2 percent milk on hand; do not use skim milk. We developed this recipe using a loaf pan that measures 8-1⁄2 by 4-1⁄2 inches; if you use a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan, start checking for doneness 5 minutes earlier than advised in the recipe.  
3 ounces Parmesan cheese, shredded on large holes of box grater (1 cup)  
2-1⁄2 cups (12-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1 tablespoon baking powder  
1 teaspoon salt  
1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper  
4 ounces extra-sharp cheddar cheese, cut into 1⁄2-inch cubes (1 cup)  
1 cup whole milk  
1⁄2 cup sour cream  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled  
1 large egg, lightly beaten  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Spray 8-1⁄2 by 4-1⁄2-inch loaf pan with vegetable oil spray, then sprinkle 1⁄2 cup Parmesan evenly in bottom of pan.  
2. In large bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, salt, cayenne, and pepper to combine. Using rubber spatula, mix in cheddar, breaking up clumps, until cheese is coated with flour. In medium bowl, whisk together milk, sour cream, butter, and egg. Using rubber spatula, gently fold wet ingredients into dry ingredients until just combined (batter will be heavy and thick; do not overmix). Scrape batter into prepared loaf pan; spread to sides of pan and level surface with rubber spatula. Sprinkle remaining 1⁄2 cup Parmesan evenly over surface.  
3. Bake until loaf is deep golden brown and toothpick inserted in center of loaf comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Let cool in pan on wire rack for 5 minutes, then invert loaf onto wire rack and turn right side up and continue to let cool until warm, about 45 minutes. Serve.

AMERICAN LOAF BREAD  
#quantity  
MAKES ONE 9-INCH LOAF  
#ingredients  
All-purpose flour can be used if bread flour is unavailable. If you don’t have a stand mixer, you can mix the dough by hand following the instructions. If you don’t have a baking stone, bake the bread on an overturned and preheated rimmed baking sheet set on the lowest oven rack.  
1 cup whole milk, heated to 110 degrees  
1⁄3 cup water, heated to 110 degrees  
3 tablespoons honey  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
3-1⁄2 cups (19-1⁄4 ounces) bread flour  
2-1⁄4 teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast  
2 teaspoons salt  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Once oven temperature reaches 200 degrees, maintain heat for 10 minutes, then turn off oven.  
2. Whisk milk, water, honey, and butter together in 4-cup liquid measuring cup. Using stand mixer fitted with dough hook, combine flour, yeast, and salt on low speed. Slowly add milk mixture and let dough come together, about 2 minutes. Increase speed to medium and knead until dough is smooth and satiny, about 10 minutes, scraping down dough from bowl and hook as needed. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and knead by hand to form smooth, round ball, about 15 seconds. Place dough in large, lightly greased bowl; cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in warm oven until doubled in size, 40 to 50 minutes.  
3. Grease 9 by 5-inch loaf pan. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and press into rectangle about 1 inch thick and no longer than 9 inches, with long side facing you. Roll dough toward you into firm cylinder, keeping roll taut by tucking it under itself as you go. Turn loaf seam side up and pinch it closed. Place loaf seam side down in prepared pan, pressing gently into corners. Cover loaf loosely with greased plastic and let rise at room temperature until nearly doubled in size, 20 to 30 minutes. (Dough should barely spring back when poked with knuckle.)  
4. One hour before baking, place baking stone on lowest rack, place empty loaf pan or other heatproof pan on baking stone, and heat oven to 350 degrees. Bring 2 cups water to boil on stovetop. Working quickly, pour boiling water into empty loaf pan in oven and set loaf in pan on baking stone. Bake until crust is golden brown and loaf registers 195 degrees, 40 to 50 minutes. Transfer pan to wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes. Remove loaf from pan, return to rack, and let cool to room temperature, about 2 hours, before slicing and serving. (Bread can be wrapped in double layer of plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 3 days. Wrapped with additional layer of aluminum foil, bread can be frozen for up to 1 month.)  
BUTTERMILK LOAF BREAD  
Substitute 1⁄3 cup buttermilk, heated to 110 degrees, for whole milk. Increase first rise to 50 minutes to 1 hour.  
OATMEAL LOAF BREAD  
Do not substitute instant oats in this recipe. To turn this loaf into Oatmeal-Raisin Bread, knead 3⁄4 cup raisins, tossed with 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, into the dough after it comes out of the mixer.  
Omit warm water from wet ingredients. Bring 3⁄4 cup water to boil in small saucepan. Stir in 3⁄4 cup old-fashioned rolled oats or quick oats and cook until softened slightly, about 90 seconds. Decrease flour to 2-3⁄4 cups and combine cooked oatmeal with flour and salt in mixer before adding milk mixture.  
CORNMEAL LOAF BREAD  
To turn this loaf into Anadama Bread, substitute 3 tablespoons molasses for honey.  
Decrease milk to 3⁄4 cup. Bring additional 1⁄2 cup water to boil in small saucepan. Slowly whisk in 1⁄4 cup cornmeal and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens, about 1 minute. Decrease flour to 3-1⁄4 cups and combine cornmeal mixture with flour and salt in mixer before incorporating milk mixture.

WHOLE WHEAT SANDWICH BREAD  
#quantity  
MAKES TWO 8-INCH LOAVES  
#ingredients  
SPONGE  
2 cups (11 ounces) bread flour  
1 cup water, heated to 110 degrees  
1⁄2 teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast  
SOAKER  
3 cups (16-1⁄2 ounces) whole wheat flour  
1⁄2 cup wheat germ  
2 cups whole milk  
DOUGH  
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened  
1⁄4 cup honey  
2 tablespoons instant or rapid-rise yeast  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
4 teaspoons salt  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE SPONGE: Combine flour, water, and yeast in large bowl and stir with wooden spoon until uniform mass forms and no dry flour remains, about 1 minute. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.  
2. FOR THE SOAKER: Combine flour, wheat germ, and milk in separate large bowl and stir with wooden spoon until shaggy mass forms, about 1 minute. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and knead by hand until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Return soaker to bowl, cover tightly with plastic, and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.  
3. FOR THE DOUGH: Tear soaker apart into 1-inch pieces and place in bowl of stand mixer fitted with dough hook. Add sponge, butter, honey, yeast, oil, and salt and mix on low speed until cohesive mass starts to form, about 2 minutes. Increase speed to medium and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and knead by hand to form smooth, round ball, about 1 minute. Place dough in large, lightly greased bowl. Cover tightly with plastic and let rise at room temperature for 45 minutes.  
4. Gently press down on center of dough to deflate. Spray rubber spatula or bowl scraper with vegetable oil spray; fold partially risen dough over itself by gently lifting and folding edge of dough toward middle. Turn bowl 90 degrees; fold again. Turn bowl and fold dough 6 more times (total of 8 folds). Cover tightly with plastic and allow to rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.  
5. Grease two 8-1⁄2 by 4-1⁄2-inch loaf pans. Transfer dough to well-floured counter and divide in half. Press 1 piece of dough into 17 by 8-inch rectangle, with short side facing you. Roll dough toward you into firm cylinder, keeping roll taut by tucking it under itself as you go. Turn loaf seam side up and pinch it closed. Place loaf seam side down in prepared pan, pressing gently into corners. Repeat with second piece of dough. Cover loaves loosely with greased plastic and let rise at room temperature until nearly doubled in size, 1 to 1-1⁄2 hours (top of loaves should rise about 1 inch over lip of pan).  
6. One hour before baking, adjust oven racks to middle and lowest positions, place baking stone on middle rack, place empty loaf pan or other heatproof pan on bottom rack, and heat oven to 400 degrees. Bring 2 cups water to boil on stovetop. Using sharp serrated knife or single-edge razor blade, make one 1⁄4-inch-deep slash lengthwise down center of each loaf. Working quickly, pour boiling water into empty loaf pan in oven and set loaves in pans on baking stone. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees. Bake until crust is dark brown and loaves register 200 degrees, 40 to 50 minutes, rotating loaves front to back and side to side halfway through baking. Transfer pans to wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes. Remove loaves from pans, return to rack, and let cool to room temperature, about 2 hours, before slicing and serving. (Bread can be wrapped in double layer of plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 3 days. Wrapped with additional layer of aluminum foil, bread can be frozen for up to 1 month.)

DOUGH  
3 large eggs, room temperature  
3⁄4 cup buttermilk, room temperature  
1⁄4 cup (1-3⁄4 ounces) granulated sugar  
2-1⁄4 teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast  
1-1⁄4 teaspoons salt  
4-1⁄4 cups (21-1⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour  
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled  
GLAZE  
6 tablespoons unsalted butter  
3⁄4 cup packed (5-1⁄4 ounces) light brown sugar  
3 tablespoons corn syrup  
2 tablespoons heavy cream  
1 pinch salt  
FILLING  
3⁄4 cup packed (5-1⁄4 ounces) light brown sugar  
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon  
1⁄4 teaspoon ground cloves  
Pinch salt  
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted and cooled  
TOPPING  
1⁄4 cup packed (1-3⁄4 ounces) light brown sugar  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter  
3 tablespoons corn syrup  
Pinch salt  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
3⁄4 cup pecans, toasted and chopped coarse  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE DOUGH: In bowl of standing mixer, whisk eggs to combine; add buttermilk and whisk to combine. Whisk in sugar, yeast, and salt. Add 2 cups flour and butter; stir with wooden spoon or rubber spatula until evenly moistened and combined. Add all but about 1⁄4 cup remaining flour and knead with dough hook at low speed for 5 minutes. Check consistency of dough (dough should feel soft and moist but not wet and sticky; add more flour, if necessary); knead for 5 minutes longer (dough should clear sides of bowl but stick to bottom). Turn dough onto lightly floured counter; knead by hand for about 1 minute to ensure dough is uniform (dough should not stick to counter; if it does stick, knead in additional flour 1 tablespoon at a time).  
2. Transfer dough to large, lightly greased bowl, spray dough lightly with vegetable oil spray, cover bowl, and set in warm, draft-free spot until doubled in volume, 2 to 2-1⁄2 hours.  
3. FOR THE GLAZE: Combine all ingredients in small saucepan and cook over medium heat, whisking occasionally, until butter is melted and mixture is thoroughly combined. Pour mixture into nonstick metal 13 by 9-inch baking pan. Using rubber spatula, spread mixture to cover surface of pan; set aside.  
4. FOR THE FILLING: Combine sugar, cinnamon, cloves, and salt in small bowl and mix until thoroughly combined, using fingers to break up sugar lumps; set aside.  
5. TO ASSEMBLE AND BAKE: Turn dough out onto lightly floured counter. Gently shape dough into rough rectangle with long side nearest you. Lightly flour dough and roll to 16 by 12-inch rectangle. Brush dough with melted butter, leaving 1⁄2-inch border along top edge; brush sides of baking dish with butter remaining on brush. Sprinkle filling mixture over dough, leaving 3⁄4-inch border along top edge; smooth filling in even layer with hand, then gently press mixture into dough to adhere. Starting at long side, roll dough, pressing lightly, to form tight cylinder. Firmly pinch seam to seal. Arrange cylinder seam side down and cut into 8 equal pieces. Very gently stretch to form cylinder of even diameter and 18-inch length, pushing ends in to create even thickness. Using serrated knife and gentle sawing motion, slice cylinder in half, then slice each half in half again to create evenly sized quarters. Slice each quarter evenly into thirds, yielding 12 buns (end pieces may be slightly smaller).  
6. Arrange buns cut side down in prepared baking pan, cover, and set in warm, draft-free spot until puffy and pressed against one another, about 1-1⁄2 hours. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lowest position, place baking stone on rack, and heat oven to 350 degrees.  
7. Place baking pan on baking stone and bake until rolls are golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool on wire rack for 10 minutes; invert onto rimmed baking sheet, large rectangular platter, or cutting board. With rubber spatula, scrape any glaze remaining in baking pan onto buns; let cool while making pecan topping.  
8. FOR THE TOPPING: Combine sugar, butter, corn syrup, and salt in small saucepan and bring to simmer over medium heat, whisking occasionally to thoroughly combine. Off heat, add vanilla and pecans and stir until pecans are evenly coated. Using soupspoon, spoon heaping 1 tablespoon nuts and topping over center of each sticky bun. Continue to let cool until sticky buns are warm, 15 to 20 minutes. Pull apart or use serrated knife to cut apart buns and serve.  
OVERNIGHT STICKY BUNS WITH PECANS  
Sticky buns can be prepared and shaped the night before and then refrigerated. Setting the baking dish in a warm-water bath the next morning speeds the dough’s rise.  
After forming and arranging buns in baking pan in step 5, cover pan and refrigerate for 10 to 14 hours. Place baking pan in warm-water bath (about 120 degrees) in kitchen sink or large roasting pan for 20 minutes. Remove from water bath and let stand at room temperature until buns look slightly puffy and are pressed against one another, about 1-1⁄2 hours. About an hour before baking, adjust oven rack to lowest position, place baking stone on rack, and heat oven to 350 degrees. Proceed with step 6 as directed.  
MAKE-AHEAD STICKY BUNS WITH PECANS  
This make-ahead version makes sticky buns possible during hectic times, like the holidays.  
After buns have risen 1-1⁄2 hours, place baking pan, covered tightly with plastic wrap, in freezer and store for up to 1 month. To bake, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Remove buns from freezer, remove plastic wrap, wrap dish tightly with aluminum foil, and set on baking sheet. Bake buns for 30 minutes, then remove foil and continue to bake until golden brown and center of dough registers about 180 degrees, about 20 minutes longer. Proceed with cooling buns and making topping as directed in step 7.  
MAKING STICKY BUNS  
#instructions  
1. Spread hot glaze in baking pan.  
2. Sprinkle dough with filling, leaving 3⁄4-inch border along top edge. If you don’t leave border, it will be harder to get dough to stick together when forming cylinder.  
3. Roll dough into tight cylinder. Do this slowly and with great care since an uneven cylinder will yield, squat, misshapen rolls.  
4. Firmly pinch seam to seal. A secure seam ensures the filling stays put.  
5. Using a serrated knife and gentle sawing motion, cut cylinder into 12 buns.  
6. Arrange buns in prepared pan over glaze.

#instructions  
1. FOR THE SPONGE: Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees; toast rye flakes, if using, on rimmed baking sheet until fragrant and golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. Using stand mixer fitted with dough hook, mix flour, water, honey, yeast, and rye flakes, if using, on low speed until mixture forms thick batter; cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let sit until bubbles form over entire surface, at least 2-1⁄2 hours. (Sponge can stand at room temperature overnight.)  
2. FOR THE DOUGH: Add all-purpose flour, 3-1⁄4 cups rye flour, caraway seeds, oil, and salt to sponge and knead on low speed until smooth yet sticky, about 5 minutes, adding remaining 1⁄4 cup rye flour once dough becomes cohesive. With moistened hands, transfer dough to well-floured counter and knead by hand to form smooth, round ball. Place dough in large, lightly greased bowl; cover tightly with plastic and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 1-1⁄4 to 2 hours.  
3. Generously sprinkle cornmeal on baking sheet. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and press into 12 by 9-inch rectangle, with long side facing you. (For 2 smaller loaves, divide dough in half, then press each piece into 9 by 6-1⁄2-inch rectangle.) Roll dough toward you into firm 12-inch (or 9-inch) cylinder, keeping roll taut by tucking it under itself as you go. Turn loaf seam side up and pinch it closed. Turn dough seam side down, and with fingertips, seal ends by tucking them into loaf. Place shaped loaf (or loaves) onto prepared baking sheet, cover loosely with greased plastic, and let rise at room temperature until dough looks bloated and dimply, and starts to spread out, 1 to 1-1⁄4 hours.  
4. Thirty minutes before baking, heat oven to 425 degrees. Brush egg white mixture over sides and top of loaf (or loaves). Using sharp serrated knife or single-edge razor blade, make six or seven 1⁄2-inch-deep slashes on dough top(s). Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees and continue to bake until crust is golden brown and loaf registers 200 degrees, 15 to 20 minutes longer for small loaves and 25 to 30 minutes for larger loaf. Transfer loaf (or loaves) to wire rack and let cool to room temperature, about 2 hours, before slicing and serving. (Bread can be wrapped in double layer of plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 3 days. Wrapped with additional layer of aluminum foil, bread can be frozen for up to 1 month. To recrisp crust, thaw bread at room temperature, if frozen, and place unwrapped bread in 450-degree oven for 6 to 8 minutes.)

ALMOST NO-KNEAD BREAD  
#quantity  
MAKES 1 LARGE ROUND LOAF  
#ingredients  
You will need at least a 6-quart Dutch oven for this recipe. An enameled cast-iron Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid yields best results, but the recipe also works in a regular cast-iron Dutch oven or heavy stockpot. Take note of the knobs on your Dutch oven lid, as not all are ovensafe at 500 degrees; look for inexpensive replacement knobs from the manufacturer of your Dutch oven (or try using a metal drawer handle from a hardware store).  
3 cups (15 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons salt  
1⁄4 teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast  
3⁄4 cup plus 2 tablespoons water, room temperature  
6 tablespoons mild-flavored lager, room temperature  
1 tablespoon white vinegar  
#instructions  
1. Whisk flour, salt, and yeast together in large bowl. Add water, beer, and vinegar. Using rubber spatula, fold mixture, scraping up dry flour from bottom of bowl, until shaggy ball forms. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 8 to 18 hours.  
2. Lay 18 by 12-inch sheet of parchment paper inside 10-inch skillet and spray with vegetable oil spray. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and knead by hand 10 to 15 times. Shape dough into ball by pulling edges into middle. Transfer loaf, seam side down, to prepared skillet and spray surface of dough with oil spray. Cover loosely with plastic and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 2 hours. (Dough should barely spring back when poked with knuckle.)  
3. Thirty minutes before baking, adjust oven rack to lowest position, place Dutch oven (with lid) on rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees. Lightly flour top of dough and, using sharp serrated knife or single-edge razor blade, make one 6-inch-long, 1⁄2-inch-deep slash along top of dough. Carefully remove pot from oven and remove lid. Pick up loaf by lifting parchment overhang and lower into pot (let any excess parchment hang over pot edge). Cover pot and place in oven. Reduce oven temperature to 425 degrees and bake, covered, for 30 minutes. Remove lid and continue to bake until crust is deep golden brown and loaf registers 210 degrees, 20 to 30 minutes longer. Carefully remove loaf from pot; transfer to wire rack, discard parchment, and let cool to room temperature, about 2 hours, before slicing and serving. (Bread is best eaten on day it is baked but will keep wrapped in double layer of plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 2 days. To recrisp crust, place unwrapped bread in 450-degree oven for 6 to 8 minutes.)  
ALMOST NO-KNEAD BREAD WITH OLIVES, ROSEMARY, AND PARMESAN  
If you prefer black olives, substitute them for the green olives, or try a mix of green and black olives.  
Add 2 cups fine-grated Parmesan cheese and 1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary to flour mixture in step 1. Add 1 cup green olives, pitted and chopped, with water.  
ALMOST NO-KNEAD SEEDED RYE BREAD  
Replace 1-3⁄8 cups all-purpose flour with 1-1⁄8 cups rye flour. Add 2 tablespoons caraway seeds to flour mixture in step 1.  
ALMOST NO-KNEAD WHOLE WHEAT BREAD  
Replace 1 cup all-purpose flour with 1 cup whole wheat flour. Stir 2 tablespoons honey into water before adding it to dry ingredients in step 1.  
ALMOST NO-KNEAD CRANBERRY-PECAN BREAD  
This bread makes especially good toast.  
Add 1⁄2 cup dried cranberries and 1⁄2 cup toasted pecans to flour mixture in step 1.

24-HOUR SOURDOUGH BREAD  
#quantity  
MAKES 2 LARGE ROUND LOAVES  
#ingredients  
SPONGE  
1⁄2 cup (4-1⁄2 ounces) refreshed starter  
3⁄8–1⁄2 cup water, heated to 80 degrees  
1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour  
DOUGH  
1-1⁄2 cups water, heated to 70 degrees  
4-3⁄4 cups (23-3⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour  
2-1⁄2 teaspoons salt  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE SPONGE: Stir starter and water together in large bowl until fully combined. Stir in flour until combined (mixture should resemble thick pancake batter). Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 2 to 3 hours.  
2. FOR THE DOUGH: Add water and sponge to bowl of stand mixer fitted with dough hook. With mixer on low speed, add flour, 1⁄2 cup at a time. Once all flour has been added, continue kneading until dough forms ball, about 1 minute longer; cover bowl tightly with plastic, and let dough rest for 20 minutes.  
3. Using fingers, create pocket in rested dough, then add salt to pocket. Knead dough on low speed until soft, smooth, and moist (dough should not be sticky), about 5 minutes. Transfer dough to clean counter and knead by hand to form firm ball, about 30 seconds. Place dough in large, lightly greased bowl, and spray surface of dough lightly with vegetable oil spray. Take internal temperature of dough; then cover tightly with plastic. If temperature is below 78 degrees, set container at room temperature (about 70 degrees) in draft-free spot; if warmer than 78 degrees, set container at cool room temperature (about 65 degrees) in draft-free spot. Let rise until dough doubles in size, 3 to 5 hours.  
4. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Transfer dough to clean counter. Gently stretch dough (to redistribute and refresh yeast) as far as possible without tearing, then fold it into thirds like business letter. Divide dough in half crosswise, then loosely shape each piece into ball, cover loosely with plastic, and let rest for 15 minutes. Cup hands stiffly around 1 piece of dough (keep other piece covered), and drag in short half-circular motions toward edge of counter, forming dough into round loaf with smooth, taut surface. Pinch bottom seam closed and set loaf seam side down on prepared baking sheet. Repeat with second piece of dough. Spray loaves lightly with oil spray, cover loosely with plastic, and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.  
5. Slide parchment and covered loaves onto clean counter, spaced at least 6 inches apart. Loosen plastic to allow loaves to rise; let rise until nearly doubled in size, 3 to 4 hours. (Dough should barely spring back when poked with knuckle.)  
6. One hour before baking, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position, place baking stone on rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees. Carefully slide parchment and rounds onto pizza peel. Using sharp serrated knife or single-edge razor blade, held at 45-degree angle to work surface, slash surface of loaves 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 inch deep. Working quickly, spray loaves with water, slide parchment with loaves onto baking stone, and immediately reduce oven temperature to 450 degrees. Bake, spraying loaves with water twice more during first 5 minutes of baking, until crust is deep golden brown and loaves register 210 degrees, about 30 minutes. Transfer loaves to wire rack, discard parchment, and let cool to room temperature, about 2 hours, before slicing and serving. (Bread can be wrapped in double layer of plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 3 days. Wrapped with additional layer of aluminum foil, bread can be frozen for up to 1 month.)  
SOURDOUGH STARTER REFRESHMENT  
If you do not already have a starter, dried starter packets (sold by mail and in some natural foods stores) or fresh mail-order starters work well. Follow the package directions to get the starter going, then follow our directions for feeding once the starter is going strong. No matter where you get your starter and how carefully you maintain it, you should refresh it according to the instructions below before using it.  
3 cups water, heated to 80 degrees  
4-1⁄2 cups (22-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
#instructions  
1. Beginning in evening, 2 days before you intend to use starter, stir starter well to recombine. Measure out and reserve 1 cup (9 ounces) of starter; discard remaining starter (or give it to a friend). Stir reserved starter and 1 cup water together in large bowl until combined, then stir in 1-1⁄2 cups flour until evenly moistened (mixture will be lumpy). Cover with plastic wrap and let mixture stand at room temperature for 8 hours to 12 hours.  
2. In morning of following day, pour off all but 1 cup starter, stir in 1 cup water, then stir in 1-1⁄2 cups flour. Repeat with pouring off starter, stirring in remaining 1 cup water and remaining 1-1⁄2 cups flour, letting it stand at room temperature for entire time. Starter will be fully refreshed and ready to use next morning, 8 to 12 hours after last feeding. (Starter can be kept alive over long period of nonuse in refrigerator. It’s best to feed it weekly, according to instructions in step 1; let it stand at room temperature for 4 to 6 hours after feeding, then return it to refrigerator.)

BAKERY-STYLE FRENCH BAGUETTES  
#quantity  
MAKES TWO 15-INCH BAGUETTES  
#ingredients  
If you don’t have a baking stone, bake the bread on an overturned and preheated rimmed baking sheet set on the lowest oven rack. This recipe will yield baguettes for breakfast; the variation uses altered rising times so that the baguettes are baked in time for dinner. In either case, begin the recipe the day before you intend to serve the bread; the baguettes will emerge from the oven 20 to 24 hours after you start the sponge. Do not add flour while kneading or shaping the dough. The baguettes are best served within 2 hours after baking.  
SPONGE  
1 cup plus 3 tablespoons (6 ounces) all-purpose flour  
3⁄4 cup water, heated to 110 degrees  
1⁄8 teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast  
DOUGH  
1⁄2 cup water, heated to 75 degrees, plus extra as needed  
1⁄2 teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast  
2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1 teaspoon salt  
1 large egg white, beaten with 1 tablespoon water  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE SPONGE: Stir flour, water, and yeast together in medium bowl with wooden spoon to form thick batter. Scrape down bowl with rubber spatula. Cover with plastic wrap and punch holes in plastic with paring knife; let stand at room temperature. After 4 or 5 hours, sponge should be almost doubled in size and pitted with tiny bubbles. Let stand at room temperature until surface shows slight depression in center, indicating drop, 2 to 3 hours longer. Sponge now is ready to use.  
2. FOR THE DOUGH: Measure out and reserve 2 tablespoons water. Add remaining water and yeast to sponge and stir briskly with wooden spoon until water is incorporated, about 30 seconds. Stir in flour and continue mixing with wooden spoon until shaggy ball forms. Transfer dough to clean counter and knead by hand, adding drops of water if necessary, until dry bits are absorbed into dough, about 2 minutes. (Dough will feel dry and tough.) Stretch dough into rough 8 by 6-inch rectangle, make indentations in dough with fingertips, sprinkle with 1 tablespoon reserved water, fold edges of dough up toward center to encase water, and pinch edges to seal. Knead dough lightly by hand, about 30 seconds (dough will feel slippery as some water escapes but will become increasingly pliant as water is absorbed).  
3. Begin “crashing” dough by flinging dough vigorously against counter. (This process helps dough absorb water more readily.) Knead and crash dough alternately until soft and supple and surface is almost powdery smooth, about 7 minutes. Stretch dough again into rough 8 by 6-inch rectangle and make indentations with fingertips; sprinkle dough with salt and remaining 1 tablespoon reserved water. Repeat folding and sealing edges and crashing and kneading until dough is once again soft and supple and surface is almost powdery smooth, about 7 minutes. If dough still feels tough and nonpliant, knead in 2 additional teaspoons water.  
4. Determine if dough is adequately kneaded by stretching piece of dough until nearly translucent. If dough tears before stretching thin, knead 5 minutes longer and test again. Gather dough into ball, place in large, lightly greased bowl, and cover with plastic. Let sit for 30 minutes, then remove dough from bowl and knead gently to deflate, about 10 seconds; gather into ball, return to bowl, and replace plastic. Let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1-1⁄2 hours.  
5. Gently press down on center of dough to deflate. Transfer dough to counter, divide in half, and loosely cover with plastic. Cup hands stiffly around 1 piece of dough (keep other piece covered) and drag in short half-circular motions toward edge of counter, forming dough into rough torpedo shape with smooth, taut surface, about 6-1⁄2 inches long. Repeat with second piece of dough. Cover dough with plastic and let rest for 15 to 20 minutes.  
6. Top inverted rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Press indentation along length of 1 piece of dough with side of outstretched hand. Working along length of dough, press thumb against dough while folding and rolling upper edge of dough down with other hand to enclose thumb. Repeat folding and rolling 4 or 5 times until upper edge meets lower edge and creates seam; press seam to seal. (Dough will have formed cylinder about 12 inches long.) Roll dough cylinder seam side down; gently and evenly roll and stretch dough until it measures 15 inches long by 2-1⁄2 inches wide. Place seam side down on prepared baking sheet. Repeat with second piece of dough and place it about 6 inches from first piece on baking sheet. Drape clean kitchen towel over dough and slide baking sheet into large clean garbage bag; seal to close. Refrigerate until dough has risen moderately, at least 12 hours or up to 16 hours.  
7. Remove baking sheet with baguettes from refrigerator and let baguettes stand covered at room temperature for 45 minutes; remove plastic bag and towel to let surface of dough dry, then let stand 15 minutes longer. (Baguettes should have nearly doubled in size and feel springy to touch.)  
8. One hour before baking, adjust oven racks to lower-middle and lowest position, place baking stone on upper rack and second rimmed baking sheet on lower rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees. Bring 1 cup water to boil on stovetop. Using sharp serrated knife or single-edge razor blade, make five 1⁄4-inch-deep diagonal slashes on each baguette. Brush baguettes with egg white mixture and mist with water. Working quickly, slide parchment with baguettes onto baking stone, then pour boiling water onto rimmed baking sheet on lower rack and quickly close oven door. Bake until crust is deep golden brown and baguettes register 210 degrees, about 15 minutes, rotating baguettes front to back and side to side after first 10 minutes of baking. Transfer baguettes to wire rack and let cool slightly, about 30 minutes, before slicing and serving.  
DINNER BAGUETTES  
The altered rising times in this version help get the baguettes on the table at the same time as dinner.  
Start sponge at about noon and use 75-degree water; let sponge rise 5 to 6 hours, then refrigerate overnight, 12 to 14 hours. In step 2, make dough using 110-degree water. Continue with recipe to knead, rise, and shape. Place shaped and covered dough in refrigerator until slightly risen, 7 to 10 hours before continuing with recipe in step 7.  
SHAPING A BAGUETTE  
#instructions  
1. Make indentation along length of dough with side of outstretched hand.  
2. Working along length of dough, press thumb against dough while folding and rolling upper edge down with other hand. Repeat 5 times until upper edge meets lower edge.  
3. Using fingertips, press seam to seal. At this point, dough will have formed cylinder about 12 inches long.  
4. Roll dough cylinder seam side down; gently and evenly roll and stretch dough until it measures 15 inches long by 2-1⁄2 inches wide.

RUSTIC ITALIAN BREAD  
#quantity  
MAKES 1 LARGE LOAF  
#ingredients  
SPONGE  
2 cups (11 ounces) bread flour  
1⁄4 teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast  
1 cup water, room temperature  
DOUGH  
3 cups (16-1⁄2 ounces) bread flour  
1 teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast  
1-1⁄3 cups water, room temperature  
2 teaspoons salt  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE SPONGE: Using stand mixer fitted with dough hook, mix flour, yeast, and water together on low speed until mixture forms shaggy dough, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer sponge to medium bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let stand at room temperature until beginning to bubble and rise, about 3 hours. Refrigerate sponge for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.  
2. FOR THE DOUGH: Remove sponge from refrigerator and let stand at room temperature while making dough. Using stand mixer fitted with dough hook, mix flour, yeast, and water together on low speed until rough dough is formed, about 3 minutes; cover bowl loosely with plastic and let dough rest for 20 minutes.  
3. Add sponge and salt to dough and knead on low speed until ingredients are incorporated and dough is formed (dough should clear sides of bowl but stick to very bottom), about 4 minutes. Increase mixer speed to medium-low and continue to knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 1 minute. Transfer dough to large, lightly greased bowl; cover tightly with plastic and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour.  
4. Spray rubber spatula or bowl scraper with vegetable oil spray. Fold partially risen dough over itself by gently lifting and folding edge of dough toward middle. Turn bowl 180 degrees; fold again. Finally, fold dough in half, perpendicular to first folds. (Dough shape should be rough square.) Cover with plastic and let dough rise for 1 hour. Repeat folding, replace plastic, and let dough rise 1 hour longer.  
5. Top pizza peel with parchment paper. Turn dough out onto well-floured counter (side of dough that was against bowl should now be facing up). Dust dough and hands liberally with flour and gently press dough into rough 10-inch square. Fold top corners of dough square into middle of dough, then gently roll and pinch dough into torpedo shape. Transfer loaf to prepared pizza peel, seam side down, and gently tuck dough into taut loaf. Spray loaf with oil spray, cover loosely with plastic, and let rise at room temperature until nearly doubled in size, 1 to 1-1⁄2 hours. (Dough should barely spring back when poked with knuckle.)  
6. One hour before baking, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position, place baking stone on rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees. Using sharp serrated knife or single-edge razor blade, make one 1⁄2 inch deep slash lengthwise along top of loaf, starting and stopping about 1-1⁄2 inches from ends. Spray loaf with water and slide parchment with loaf onto baking stone. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees and quickly rotate loaf using edges of parchment; continue to bake until crust is deep golden brown and loaf registers 210 degrees, about 35 minutes longer. Transfer loaf to wire rack, discard parchment, and let cool to room temperature, about 2 hours, before slicing and serving. (Bread can be wrapped in double layer of plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 3 days. Wrapped with additional layer of aluminum foil, bread can be frozen for up to 1 month.)

MAKES 2 LOAVES  
#ingredients  
If you don’t have a baking stone, bake the bread on an overturned and preheated rimmed baking sheet set on the lowest oven rack. As you make this bread, keep in mind that the dough is wet and very sticky. The key to manipulating it is working quickly and gently; rough handling will result in flat, tough loaves. When possible, use a large rubber spatula or bowl scraper to move the dough. If you have to use your hands, make sure they are well floured. Because the dough is so sticky, it must be prepared in a stand mixer.  
SPONGE  
1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄8 teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast  
1⁄2 cup water, room temperature  
DOUGH  
2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons salt  
1⁄2 teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast  
3⁄4 cup water, room temperature  
1⁄4 cup milk, room temperature  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE SPONGE: Combine flour, yeast, and water in medium bowl and stir with wooden spoon until uniform mass forms, about 1 minute. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.  
2. FOR THE DOUGH: Place sponge and dough ingredients in bowl of stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until roughly combined and shaggy dough forms, about 1 minute, scraping down bowl and paddle as needed. Increase speed to medium-low and continue mixing until dough becomes uniform mass that collects on paddle and pulls away from sides of bowl, 4 to 6 minutes. Change to dough hook and knead bread on medium speed until smooth and shiny (dough will be very sticky), about 10 minutes, scraping down bowl and dough hook as needed. Transfer dough to large bowl, cover tightly with plastic, and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour. (Dough should barely spring back when poked with knuckle.)  
3. Spray rubber spatula or bowl scraper with vegetable oil spray. Fold partially risen dough over itself by gently lifting and folding edge of dough toward middle. Turn bowl 90 degrees; fold again. Turn bowl and fold dough 6 more times (for total of 8 turns). Cover with plastic and let rise for 30 minutes. Repeat folding, replace plastic, and let rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes longer.  
4. One hour before baking, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position, place baking stone on rack, and heat oven to 450 degrees. Cut two 12 by 6-inch pieces of parchment paper and dust liberally with flour. Transfer dough to floured counter, being careful not to deflate it completely. Liberally flour top of dough and divide in half with bench scraper. Turn 1 piece of dough cut side up and dust with flour. With well-floured hands, press dough into rough 12 by 6-inch rectangle. Fold shorter sides of dough toward center, overlapping them like business letter to form 7 by 4-inch loaf. Repeat with second piece of dough. Gently transfer each loaf, seam side down, to parchment sheets, dust with flour, and cover with plastic. Let loaves sit at room temperature for 30 minutes (surface of loaves will develop small bubbles).  
5. Slide parchment with loaves onto pizza peel. Using floured fingertips, evenly poke entire surface of each loaf to form 10 by 6-inch rectangle; spray loaves lightly with water. Slide parchment with loaves onto baking stone. Bake, spraying loaves with water twice more during first 5 minutes of baking time, until crust is deep golden brown and loaves register 210 degrees, 22 to 27 minutes. Transfer loaves to wire rack, discard parchment, and let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour, before slicing and serving. (Bread can be wrapped in double layer of plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 3 days. Wrapped with additional layer of aluminum foil, bread can be frozen for up to 1 month. To recrisp crust, thaw bread at room temperature, if frozen, and place unwrapped bread in 450-degree oven for 6 to 8 minutes.)

If bulk sausage is not available, just buy cased sausage, remove the casing, and break the meat into bite-size chunks. If you don’t have a baking stone, bake the pizzas on an overturned and preheated rimmed baking sheet set on the lowest oven rack. You can shape the second dough round while the first pizza bakes, but don’t add the toppings until just before baking. For more information on shaping the pizza dough, see “SHAPING PIZZA DOUGH”.  
1 tablespoon olive oil, plus extra as needed  
4 ounces pork sausage, broken into bite-size pieces  
1 red or yellow bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and cut into thin strips  
Salt and pepper

1. One hour before baking, adjust oven rack to lowest position, set baking stone on rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees.  
2. Meanwhile, heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add sausage and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Remove sausage with slotted spoon and transfer to paper towel–lined plate. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet, add bell pepper, and cook over medium heat until softened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste; set aside.  
3. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter, divide in half, and cover with greased plastic wrap. Use fingertips to gently flatten 1 piece of dough into 8-inch disk (keep other piece covered). Using hands, gently stretch disk into 14-inch round, working along outer edge and giving disk quarter turns. Transfer dough to piece of parchment paper and reshape as needed.  
4. Using back of spoon or ladle, spread 3⁄4 cup tomato sauce over dough, leaving 1⁄2-inch border around edge. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons basil, half of sausage, and half of pepper over sauce. Slide parchment with pizza onto pizza peel, then slide onto baking stone. Bake until crust begins to brown, 7 to 8 minutes.  
5. Remove pizza from oven by sliding parchment back onto pizza peel, close oven door, and top pizza evenly with 1⁄2 cup mozzarella. Return pizza to baking stone and continue baking until cheese is just melted, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer to cutting board and discard parchment; slice and serve immediately.

PIZZA MARGHERITA  
#quantity  
MAKES TWO 12-INCH PIZZAS, SERVING 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
If you don’t have a baking stone, bake the pizzas on an overturned and preheated rimmed baking sheet set on the lowest oven rack. You can shape the second dough round while the first pizza bakes, but don’t add the toppings until just before baking. If desired, you can slow down the dough’s rising time by letting it rise in the refrigerator for 8 to 16 hours in step 2; let the refrigerated dough soften at room temperature for 30 minutes before using.  
DOUGH  
1-3⁄4 cups (8-3⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour, plus extra as needed  
1 cup (4 ounces) cake flour  
2 teaspoons sugar  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons salt  
1-1⁄4 teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast  
1 cup water, heated to 110 degrees, plus extra as needed  
TOPPING  
1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes  
1⁄2 teaspoon sugar  
1 small garlic clove, minced (optional)  
1⁄4 cup chopped fresh basil  
Salt  
8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 1-inch pieces and patted dry with paper towels  
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE DOUGH: Pulse flours, sugar, salt, and yeast in food processor (fitted with dough blade if possible) until combined, about 5 pulses. With food processor running, slowly add water; process until dough forms satiny, sticky ball that clears sides of bowl, 1-1⁄2 to 2 minutes. (If after 1 minute dough is sticky and clings to blade, add 1 to 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour and continue processing. If dough appears dry and crumbly, add 1 to 2 tablespoons water and process until dough forms a ball.)  
2. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and knead by hand into smooth, round ball. Place dough in large, lightly oiled bowl; cover bowl tightly with greased plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour.  
3. FOR THE TOPPING: While dough rises, pulse tomatoes in clean bowl of food processor until coarsely ground, 2 or 3 pulses. Transfer tomatoes to fine-mesh strainer set over bowl and let drain at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to release their liquid. Just before shaping pizza rounds, combine drained tomatoes, sugar, garlic, if using, 1 tablespoon basil, and 1⁄4 teaspoon salt in bowl.  
4. TO TOP AND BAKE THE PIZZA: Thirty minutes before baking, adjust oven rack to lowest position, set baking stone on rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter, divide in half, and cover with greased plastic. Use fingertips to gently flatten 1 piece of dough into 8-inch disk (keep other piece covered). Using hands, gently stretch disk into 12-inch round, working along outer edge and giving disk quarter turns. Transfer dough to piece of parchment paper and reshape as needed. Using back of spoon or ladle, spread thin layer of tomato topping (about 1⁄2 cup) over dough, leaving 1⁄2-inch border around edge. Slide parchment with pizza onto pizza peel, then slide onto baking stone. Bake until crust begins to brown, about 5 minutes.  
5. Remove pizza from oven by sliding parchment with pizza back onto pizza peel, close oven door, and top pizza evenly with half of mozzarella. Return pizza to baking stone and continue baking until cheese is just melted, 4 to 5 minutes more. Transfer to cutting board and discard parchment; sprinkle with half of remaining basil, 1 teaspoon olive oil, and pinch salt. Slice and serve immediately. Repeat steps 4 and 5 to shape, top, and bake second pizza.

NEW YORK–STYLE THIN-CRUST PIZZA  
#quantity  
MAKES TWO 13-INCH PIZZAS, SERVING 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
If you don’t have a baking stone, bake the pizzas on an overturned and preheated rimmed baking sheet. You can shape the second dough round while the first pizza bakes, but don’t add the toppings until just before baking. You will need a pizza peel for this recipe. It is important to use ice water in the dough to prevent it from overheating in the food processor. Semolina flour is ideal for dusting the peel; use it in place of bread flour if you have it. The sauce will yield more than needed in the recipe; extra sauce can be refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 1 month.  
DOUGH  
3 cups (16-1⁄2 ounces) bread flour  
2 teaspoons sugar  
1⁄2 teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast  
1-1⁄3 cups ice water  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons salt  
SAUCE  
1 (28-ounce) can whole tomatoes, drained  
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil  
1 teaspoon red wine vinegar  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
1 teaspoon salt  
1 teaspoon dried oregano  
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper  
CHEESE  
1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated fine (1⁄2 cup)  
8 ounces whole-milk mozzarella, shredded (2 cups)  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE DOUGH: Pulse flour, sugar, and yeast in food processor (fitted with dough blade if possible) until combined, about 5 pulses. With food processor running, slowly add water; process until dough is just combined and no dry flour remains, about 10 seconds. Let dough sit for 10 minutes.  
2. Add oil and salt to dough and process until dough forms satiny, sticky ball that clears sides of bowl, 30 to 60 seconds. Transfer dough to lightly oiled counter and knead briefly by hand until smooth, about 1 minute. Shape dough into tight ball and place in large, lightly oiled bowl; cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours or up to 3 days.  
3. FOR THE SAUCE: Process all ingredients in clean bowl of food processor until smooth, about 30 seconds. Transfer to bowl and refrigerate until ready to use.  
4. TO TOP AND BAKE THE PIZZA: One hour before baking, adjust oven rack to upper-middle position (rack should be about 4 to 5 inches from broiler), set baking stone on rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees. Transfer dough to clean counter and divide in half. With cupped palms, form each half into smooth, tight ball. Place balls of dough on lightly greased baking sheet, spacing them at least 3 inches apart; cover loosely with greased plastic and let sit for 1 hour.  
5. Coat 1 ball of dough generously with flour and place on well-floured counter (keep other ball covered). Use fingertips to gently flatten dough into 8-inch disk, leaving 1 inch of outer edge slightly thicker than center. Using hands, gently stretch disk into 12-inch round, working along edges and giving disk quarter turns. Transfer dough to well-floured pizza peel and stretch into 13-inch round. Using back of spoon or ladle, spread 1⁄2 cup tomato sauce in thin layer over surface of dough, leaving 1⁄4-inch border around edge. Sprinkle 1⁄4 cup Parmesan evenly over sauce, followed by 1 cup mozzarella. Slide pizza carefully onto baking stone and bake until crust is well browned and cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating pizza halfway through baking. Transfer pizza to wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving. Repeat step 5 to shape, top, and bake second pizza.

GRILLED TOMATO AND CHEESE PIZZA  
#quantity  
MAKES FOUR 9-INCH PIZZAS, SERVING 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
The pizzas cook very quickly on the grill, so before you begin, be sure to have all the equipment and ingredients you need at hand. Equipment includes a pizza peel (or baking sheet), a pair of tongs, a paring knife, a large cutting board, and a pastry brush. Ingredients includes all the toppings and a small bowl of flour for dusting. The pizzas are best served hot off the grill but can be kept warm for 20 to 30 minutes on a wire rack in a 200-degree oven.  
DOUGH  
1 cup water, room temperature  
2 tablespoons olive oil  
2 cups (11 ounces) bread flour  
1 tablespoon whole wheat flour (optional)  
2 teaspoons sugar  
1-1⁄4 teaspoons salt  
1 teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast  
TOPPING  
1-1⁄2 pounds plum tomatoes, cored, seeded, and cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
6 ounces fontina cheese, shredded (1-1⁄2 cups)  
1-1⁄2 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated fine (3⁄4 cup)  
1 recipe SPICY GARLIC OIL  
1⁄2 cup chopped fresh basil  
Kosher salt  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE DOUGH: Combine water and 2 tablespoons oil in liquid measuring cup. Pulse 1-3⁄4 cup bread flour, whole wheat flour, if using, sugar, salt, and yeast in food processor (fitted with dough blade if possible) until combined, about 5 pulses. With food processor running, slowly add water mixture; process until dough forms ball, about 1-1⁄2 minutes. (If after 1-1⁄2 minutes dough is sticky and clings to blade, add remaining 1⁄4 cup flour 1 tablespoon at a time.) Transfer dough to large, lightly greased bowl; cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 1-1⁄2 to 2 hours.  
2. Gently press down on center of dough to deflate. Transfer dough to clean counter and divide into 4 equal pieces. With cupped palms, form each piece into smooth, tight ball. Set dough balls on well-floured counter. Press dough rounds by hand to flatten; cover loosely with plastic and let rest for 15 minutes.  
3. FOR THE TOPPING: Meanwhile, toss tomatoes and salt in bowl; transfer to colander and drain for 30 minutes (wipe out and reserve bowl). Shake colander to drain off excess liquid; transfer tomatoes to now-empty bowl and set aside. Combine fontina and Parmesan in second bowl and set aside.  
4. Gently stretch 1 dough round (keep other rounds covered) into disk about 1⁄2 inch thick and 5 to 6 inches in diameter. Roll disk out to 1⁄8-inch thickness, 9 to 10 inches in diameter, on well-floured sheet of parchment paper, dusting with additional flour as needed to prevent sticking. (If dough shrinks when rolled out, cover with plastic and let rest until relaxed, 10 to 15 minutes.) Dust surface of rolled dough with flour and set aside. Repeat with remaining dough rounds, stacking sheets of rolled dough on top of each other (with parchment in between) and covering stack with plastic; set aside until grill is ready.  
5A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over three-quarters of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.  
5B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and turn off other burner(s).  
6. Clean and oil cooking grate. Lightly flour pizza peel or baking sheet; invert 1 dough round onto peel, gently stretching it as needed to retain its shape (do not stretch dough too thin; thin spots will burn quickly). Peel off and discard parchment; carefully slide round onto hotter side of grill. Immediately repeat with another dough round. Cook (covered if using gas) until tops are covered with bubbles (pierce larger bubbles with paring knife) and bottoms are grill-marked and charred in spots, 1 to 4 minutes; while rounds cook, check undersides and slide to cooler area of grill if browning too quickly. Transfer crusts to cutting board, browned sides up. Repeat with 2 remaining dough rounds.  
7. Brush 2 crusts generously with garlic oil; top each evenly with one-quarter of cheese mixture and one-quarter of tomatoes. Return pizzas to hotter side of grill and cover grill with lid; cook until bottoms are well browned and cheese is melted, 2 to 6 minutes, checking bottoms frequently to prevent burning. Transfer pizzas to cutting board; repeat with remaining 2 crusts. Sprinkle pizzas with basil and season with salt to taste; cut into wedges and serve.

CHICAGO-STYLE DEEP-DISH PIZZA  
#quantity  
MAKES TWO 9-INCH PIZZAS, SERVING 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
This dough must be prepared in a stand mixer. Place a damp kitchen towel under the mixer and watch it at all times during kneading to prevent it from wobbling off the counter. Handle the dough with slightly oiled hands to prevent sticking. Grate the onion on the large holes of a box grater.  
DOUGH  
3-1⁄4 cups (16-1⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄2 cup (2-3⁄4 ounces) yellow cornmeal  
2-1⁄4 teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast  
2 teaspoons sugar  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons salt  
1-1⁄4 cups water, room temperature  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus 4 tablespoons, softened  
1 teaspoon plus 4 tablespoons olive oil  
SAUCE  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1⁄4 cup grated onion  
1⁄4 teaspoon dried oregano  
Salt and pepper  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes  
1⁄4 teaspoon sugar  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil  
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil  
TOPPINGS  
1 pound mozzarella, shredded (4 cups)  
1⁄4 cup grated Parmesan cheese  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE DOUGH: Using stand mixer fitted with dough hook, mix together flour, cornmeal, yeast, sugar, and salt on low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Add water and melted butter and mix until fully combined, 1 to 2 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. Increase speed to medium and knead until dough is glossy and smooth and pulls away from sides of bowl, 4 to 5 minutes. (Dough will only pull away from sides while mixer is on. When mixer is off, the dough will fall back to sides.)  
2. Using fingers, coat large bowl with 1 teaspoon of olive oil, rubbing excess oil from fingers onto blade of rubber spatula. Using oiled spatula, transfer dough to prepared bowl, turning once to oil top. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let dough rise at room temperature until nearly doubled in size, 45 minutes to 1 hour.  
3. FOR THE SAUCE: While dough rises, melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, oregano, and 1⁄2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomatoes and sugar, bring to simmer, and cook until sauce has reduced to 2-1⁄2 cups, 25 to 30 minutes. Off heat, stir in basil and oil, then season with salt and pepper to taste.  
4. TO LAMINATE THE DOUGH: Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Using rubber spatula, turn dough out onto dry clean counter and roll into 15 by 12-inch rectangle with short side facing you. Spread softened butter over surface of dough using offset spatula, leaving 1⁄2-inch border along edges. Starting at short end, roll dough into tight cylinder. With seam side down, flatten cylinder into 18 by 4-inch rectangle. Cut rectangle in half crosswise. Working with 1 half at a time, fold dough into thirds like business letter, then pinch seams together to form ball. Return dough balls to oiled bowl, cover tightly with plastic, and let rise in refrigerator until nearly doubled in size, 40 to 50 minutes.  
5. Coat two 9-inch round cake pans with 2 tablespoons olive oil each. Transfer 1 dough ball to clean counter and roll into 13-inch disk about 1⁄4 inch thick. Transfer dough round to cake pan by rolling dough loosely around rolling pin, then unrolling dough into pan. Lightly press dough into pan, working it into corners and 1 inch up sides. If dough resists stretching, let it relax 5 minutes before trying again. Repeat with remaining dough ball.  
6. TO TOP AND BAKE THE PIZZA: For each pizza, sprinkle 2 cups of mozzarella evenly over surface of dough. Spread 1-1⁄4 cups of tomato sauce over cheese and sprinkle 2 tablespoons of Parmesan over sauce for each pizza. Bake until crust is golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove pizzas from oven and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.  
CHICAGO-STYLE DEEP-DISH PIZZA WITH SAUSAGE  
Cook 1 pound hot Italian sausage, casings removed, in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, breaking it into 1⁄2-inch pieces with wooden spoon, until browned, about 5 minutes. Remove sausage with slotted spoon and transfer to paper towel–lined plate. Sprinkle half of cooked sausage over mozzarella in each pizza before continuing with additional toppings in step 6.  
CHICAGO-STYLE DEEP-DISH PIZZA WITH OLIVES, RICOTTA, AND ARUGULA  
Sprinkle each pizza with 2 tablespoons chopped pitted kalamata olives along with Parmesan in step 6. Using 2 tablespoons ricotta cheese per pizza, dot surface with teaspoons of cheese. Bake as directed. Remove pizzas from oven and sprinkle 1⁄4 cup chopped arugula over surface of each pizza.

2. Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lowest positions and heat oven to 200 degrees. Once oven temperature reaches 200 degrees, maintain heat for 10 minutes, then turn off oven.  
3. Using stand mixer fitted with dough hook, mix 1⁄2 cup flour, 1⁄2 cup water, and yeast together on low speed until combined; cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let sit until bubbly, about 20 minutes.  
4. Add 2 tablespoons oil, remaining 3 cups flour, remaining 1⁄2 cup water, salt, and potato to flour mixture and mix on low speed until dough comes together. Increase speed to medium and knead until dough comes together and is slightly tacky, about 5 minutes. Transfer dough to large, lightly greased bowl; cover tightly with plastic and let rise on lower rack in warm oven until doubled in size, 30 to 35 minutes.  
5. Grease bottom of 14-inch cake pan with remaining 4 tablespoons oil. Remove dough from oven; transfer to clean counter and press into 12-inch round. Transfer round to pan, cover with plastic, and let rest until dough no longer resists shaping, about 10 minutes. Uncover dough and pull up into edges and up sides of pan to form 1-inch-high lip. Cover with plastic; let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.  
6. FOR THE TOPPING: Mix tomatoes and garlic together in bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste; set aside.  
7. TO BAKE THE PIZZA: One hour before baking, set baking stone on lower rack and heat oven to 425 degrees. Uncover dough and prick generously with fork. Bake on baking stone until dry and lightly browned, about 15 minutes.  
8. Remove pizza from oven. Spread partially baked crust with tomato mixture; sprinkle with mozzarella, then Parmesan. Return pizza to baking stone and continue baking until cheese melts, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Move pizza to upper rack and continue to bake until cheese is spotty brown, about 5 minutes longer. Remove pizza from oven, sprinkle with basil, and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

SERVES 12  
#ingredients  
The pizza dough will be very sticky; be sure to coat the counter, rolling pin, and your hands with extra flour as needed. You will need about 1 tablespoon of oil to brush over the dough before rising.  
DOUGH  
4-3⁄4–5 cups (23-3⁄4 to 25 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1-1⁄2 tablespoons instant or rapid-rise yeast  
1 tablespoon sugar  
2 teaspoons salt  
1⁄4 cup olive oil  
1-3⁄4 cups water, heated to 110 degrees  
TOPPING  
5 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra as needed  
3 garlic cloves, minced  
2 tablespoons tomato paste  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons dried oregano  
1⁄4 teaspoon red pepper flakes  
1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil  
Salt  
3 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated (1-1⁄2 cups)  
12 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded (3 cups)  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE DOUGH: Pulse 4-3⁄4 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in food processor (fitted with dough blade if possible) until combined, about 5 pulses. With processor running, slowly add oil, then water; process until rough ball forms, 30 to 40 seconds. Let dough rest for 2 minutes, then process for 30 seconds longer. (If after 30 seconds the dough is sticky and clings to the blade, add remaining 1⁄4 cup flour 1 tablespoon at a time as needed.)  
2. Turn dough out onto lightly floured counter and form smooth, round ball. Place the dough in large, lightly oiled bowl and cover tightly with greased plastic wrap. Let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, 1 to 1-1⁄2 hours.  
3. FOR THE TOPPING: Heat 1 tablespoon oil and garlic in saucepan over medium heat until sizzling and fragrant, about 1-1⁄2 minutes. Stir in tomato paste, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, stirring often, until paste begins to brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in crushed tomatoes and simmer until sauce is thickened, about 10 minutes. Off heat, stir in basil and season with salt to taste.  
4. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Coat 18 by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet with remaining 1⁄4 cup oil. Turn dough out onto lightly floured counter and flatten it into rough rectangle. Roll dough into 16 by 12-inch rectangle and press into prepared pan. Shape edges of dough against pan and brush dough lightly with oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in warm place until puffy, 30 to 45 minutes.  
5. Press dough with fingertips to dimple it, then sprinkle evenly with 1 cup Parmesan. Bake until Parmesan begins to brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Working quickly, spread tomato sauce over dough, leaving 1-inch border around edge. Bake until sauce darkens and steams, 7 to 10 minutes. Working quickly, sprinkle with remaining 1⁄2 cup Parmesan and mozzarella. Continue to bake until cheese is melted, 10 to 15 minutes, rotating pizza halfway through baking.  
6. Let pizza cool in pan for 1 minute, then lift onto cutting board with wide spatula. Cut into squares and serve hot.

1 teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast  
Kosher salt  
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE SPONGE: Combine flour, water, and yeast in large bowl and stir with wooden spoon until uniform mass forms and no dry flour remains, about 1 minute. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours. Use immediately or store in refrigerator for up to 3 days (allow to stand at room temperature 30 minutes before proceeding with recipe).  
2. FOR THE DOUGH: Stir flour, water, and yeast into sponge with wooden spoon until uniform mass forms and no dry flour remains, about 1 minute. Cover with plastic and let rise at room temperature for 15 minutes.  
3. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons salt over dough; stir into dough until thoroughly incorporated, about 1 minute. Cover with plastic and let rise at room temperature for 30 minutes. Spray rubber spatula or bowl scraper with vegetable oil spray. Fold partially risen dough over itself by gently lifting and folding edge of dough toward middle. Turn bowl 90 degrees; fold again. Turn bowl and fold dough 6 more times (for total of 8 folds). Cover with plastic and let rise for 30 minutes. Repeat folding, turning, and rising 2 more times, for total of three 30-minute rises.  
4. One hour before baking, adjust oven rack to upper-middle position, place baking stone on rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees. Gently transfer dough to lightly floured counter. Lightly dust top of dough with flour and divide it in half. Shape each piece of dough into 5-inch round by gently tucking under edges. Coat two 9-inch round cake pans with 2 tablespoons oil each. Sprinkle each pan with 1⁄2 teaspoon salt. Place round of dough in 1 pan, top side down; slide dough around pan to coat bottom and sides with oil, then flip dough over. Repeat with second piece of dough. Cover pans with plastic and let rest for 5 minutes.  
5. Using fingertips, press dough out toward edges of pan, taking care not to tear it. (If dough resists stretching, let it relax for 5 to 10 minutes before trying to stretch it again.) Using dinner fork, poke entire surface of dough 25 to 30 times, popping any large bubbles. Sprinkle rosemary evenly over top of dough. Let dough rest in pans until slightly bubbly, 5 to 10 minutes.  
6. Place pans on baking stone and lower oven temperature to 450 degrees. Bake until tops are golden brown, 25 to 28 minutes, rotating pans halfway through baking. Transfer pans to wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes. Remove loaves from pans and return to rack. Brush tops with any oil remaining in pans. Cool for 30 minutes before serving. (Leftover bread can be wrapped in double layer of plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for 2 days. Wrapped with additional layer of aluminum foil, bread can be frozen for up to 1 month.)

Pour warm butter over sugar and cream cheese and whisk to combine (some small lumps of cream cheese will remain but will smooth out later). Whisk in oil until incorporated. Add egg, milk, and vanilla; continue to whisk until smooth. Add flour mixture and mix with rubber spatula until soft, homogeneous dough forms.  
3. Working with 2 tablespoons of dough at a time, roll into balls. Working in batches, roll half of dough balls in sugar to coat and set on prepared baking sheet; repeat with remaining dough balls. Using bottom of greased measuring cup, flatten dough balls until 2 inches in diameter. Sprinkle tops of cookies evenly with sugar remaining in shallow dish for rolling, using 2 teaspoons for each baking sheet. (Discard remaining sugar.)  
4. Bake 1 sheet at a time until edges of cookies are set and beginning to brown, 11 to 13 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes; transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool to room temperature.  
CHEWY CHAI-SPICE SUGAR COOKIES  
Add 1⁄4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1⁄4 teaspoon ground ginger, 1⁄4 teaspoon ground cardamom, 1⁄4 teaspoon ground cloves, and pinch pepper to sugar and cream cheese mixture and reduce vanilla to 1 teaspoon.  
CHEWY COCONUT-LIME SUGAR COOKIES  
Whisk 1⁄2 cup sweetened shredded coconut, chopped fine, into flour mixture in step 1. Add 1 teaspoon finely grated lime zest to sugar and cream cheese mixture and substitute 1 tablespoon lime juice for vanilla.  
CHEWY HAZELNUT–BROWNED BUTTER SUGAR COOKIES  
Add 1⁄4 cup finely chopped toasted hazelnuts to sugar and cream cheese mixture. Instead of melting butter, heat it in 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until melted, about 2 minutes. Continue to cook, swirling pan constantly until butter is dark golden brown and has nutty aroma, 1 to 3 minutes. Immediately pour butter over sugar and cream cheese mixture and proceed with recipe as directed, increasing milk to 2 tablespoons and omitting vanilla.

Cream of tartar is essential to the flavor of these cookies and it works in combination with the baking soda to give the cookies lift; do not substitute baking powder. For best results, bake only one sheet of cookies at a time.  
1-3⁄4 cups (12-1⁄4 ounces) sugar  
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon  
2-1⁄2 cups (12-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
2 teaspoons cream of tartar  
1 teaspoon baking soda  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened  
8 tablespoons vegetable shortening  
2 large eggs

PECAN SANDIES  
#quantity  
MAKES ABOUT 32 COOKIES  
#ingredients  
Don’t substitute another type of sugar for the confectioners’ sugar—it is important for a tender, sandy texture.  
2 cups (8 ounces) pecans, toasted  
1⁄2 cup packed (3-1⁄2 ounces) light brown sugar  
1⁄4 cup (1 ounce) confectioners’ sugar  
1-1⁄2 cups (7-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces and chilled  
1 large egg yolk  
#instructions  
1. Reserve 32 of prettiest pecan halves for garnishing. Process remaining cups pecans with brown sugar and confectioners’ sugar in food processor until nuts are finely ground, about 20 seconds. Add flour and salt and process to combine, about 10 seconds.  
2. Add butter pieces and process until mixture resembles damp sand and rides up sides of bowl, about 20 seconds. With processor running, add egg yolk and process until dough comes together into rough ball, about 20 seconds.  
3. Transfer dough to clean counter, knead briefly, and divide into 2 equal pieces. Roll each piece of dough into a 6-inch log, about 2 inches thick. Wrap dough tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.  
4. Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 325 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  
5. Working with 1 dough log at a time, remove dough log from plastic and, using chef’s knife, slice into 3⁄8-inch-thick rounds, rotating dough so that it won’t become misshapen from weight of knife. Place rounds 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Gently press pecan half in center of each cookie. Bake until edges of cookies are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes, switching and rotating baking sheets halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on baking sheets for 3 minutes, then transfer to wire rack and let cool completely.

BROWN SUGAR COOKIES  
#quantity  
MAKES ABOUT 24 COOKIES  
#ingredients  
Avoid using a nonstick skillet to brown the butter; the dark color of the nonstick coating makes it difficult to gauge when the butter is sufficiently browned. Use fresh, moist brown sugar, as hardened brown sugar will make the cookies too dry. Achieving the proper texture—crisp at the edges and chewy in the middle—is critical to this recipe. Because the cookies are so dark, it’s hard to judge doneness by color. Instead, gently press halfway between the edge and center of the cookie. When it’s done, it will form an indentation with slight resistance. Check early and err on the side of underdone.  
14 tablespoons unsalted butter  
2 cups packed (14 ounces) dark brown sugar  
1⁄4 cup (1-3⁄4 ounces) granulated sugar  
2 cups plus 2 tablespoons (10-2⁄3 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄2 teaspoon baking soda  
1⁄4 teaspoon baking powder  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
1 large egg plus 1 large yolk  
1 tablespoon vanilla extract  
#instructions  
1. Melt 10 tablespoons butter in 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Continue cooking, swirling pan constantly, until butter is dark golden brown and has nutty aroma, 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer browned butter to large heatproof bowl. Add remaining 4 tablespoons butter and stir until completely melted; set aside for 15 minutes.  
2. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. In shallow baking dish or pie plate, mix 1⁄4 cup brown sugar and granulated sugar until well combined; set aside. Whisk flour, baking soda, and baking powder together in medium bowl; set aside.  
3. Add remaining 1-3⁄4 cups brown sugar and salt to bowl with cooled butter; mix until no sugar lumps remain, about 30 seconds. Scrape down bowl; add egg, egg yolk, and vanilla and mix until fully incorporated, about 30 seconds. Scrape down bowl. Add flour mixture and mix until just combined, about 1 minute. Give dough final stir to ensure that no flour pockets remain.  
4. Working with 2 tablespoons of dough at a time, roll into balls. Roll half of dough balls into sugar mixture to coat. Place dough balls 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheet; repeat with remaining dough balls.  
5. Bake 1 sheet at a time until cookies are browned and still puffy and edges have begun to set but centers are still soft (cookies will look raw between cracks and seem underdone), 12 to 14 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking.

The cookies are best eaten the day they are glazed.  
COOKIES  
3⁄4 cup (5-1⁄4 ounces) granulated sugar  
2 tablespoons grated lemon zest plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice (2 lemons)  
1-3⁄4 cup (8-3⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1⁄4 teaspoon baking powder  
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄2-inch cubes and chilled  
1 large egg yolk  
1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
GLAZE  
1 tablespoon cream cheese, softened  
2 tablespoons lemon juice  
1-1⁄2 cups (6 ounces) confectioners’ sugar  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE COOKIES: Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 375 degrees.  
2. In food processor, process granulated sugar and lemon zest until sugar looks damp and zest is thoroughly incorporated, about 30 seconds. Add flour, salt, and baking powder; pulse to combine, about 10 pulses. Scatter butter over flour mixture; pulse until mixture resembles fine cornmeal, about 15 pulses. In measuring cup, beat lemon juice, egg yolk, and vanilla with fork to combine. With processor running, add juice mixture in slow, steady stream (process should take about 10 seconds); continue processing until dough begins to form ball, 10 to 15 seconds longer.  
3. Turn dough and any dry bits onto counter; working quickly, gently knead together to ensure that no dry bits remain and dough is homogeneous. Shape dough into log about 10 inches long and 2 inches in diameter. Wrap log in parchment paper and twist ends to seal. Chill dough until firm, about 45 minutes in freezer or 2 hours in refrigerator.  
4. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Remove dough log from parchment and, using chef’s knife, slice dough into 3⁄8-inch-thick rounds, rotating dough so that it won’t become misshapen from weight of knife. Place rounds 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Bake until centers of cookies just begin to color and edges are golden brown, 14 to 16 minutes, switching and rotating baking sheets halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes; transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool to room temperature before glazing.  
5. FOR THE GLAZE: Whisk cream cheese and lemon juice in medium bowl until no lumps remain. Add confectioners’ sugar and whisk until smooth.  
6. TO GLAZE THE COOKIES: When cookies have cooled, working with one at a time, spread glaze evenly over each cookie with back of spoon. Let cookies stand on wire rack until glaze is set and dry, about 1 hour.  
GLAZED LEMON-ORANGE CORNMEAL COOKIES  
Substitute 1 tablespoon grated orange zest for equal amount of lemon zest and 1⁄4 cup cornmeal for equal amount of flour.  
GLAZED LEMON AND CRYSTALLIZED GINGER COOKIES  
Process 3 tablespoons finely chopped crystallized ginger along with sugar and lemon zest.

BEST SHORTBREAD  
#quantity  
MAKES 16 WEDGES  
#ingredients  
Use the collar of a springform pan to form the shortbread into an even round. Mold the shortbread with the collar in the closed position, then open the collar, but leave it in place. This allows the shortbread to expand slightly but keeps it from spreading too far. The extracted round of dough in step 2 is baked alongside the rest of the shortbread. Wrapped well and stored at room temperature, the shortbread will keep for up to 1 week.  
1⁄2 cup (1-1⁄2 ounces) old-fashioned rolled oats  
1-1⁄2 cups (7-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄4 cup cornstarch  
2⁄3 cup (2-2⁄3 ounces) confectioners’ sugar  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
14 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and cut into 1⁄8-inch-thick slices  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Pulse oats in spice grinder or blender until reduced to fine powder, about 10 pulses (you should have 1⁄4 to 1⁄3 cup oat flour). Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, mix oat flour, all-purpose flour, cornstarch, sugar, and salt on low speed until combined, about 5 seconds. Add butter to dry ingredients and continue to mix until dough just forms and pulls away from sides of bowl, 5 to 10 minutes.  
2. Place upside-down (grooved edge should be at top) collar of 9- or 9-1⁄2-inch springform pan on parchment paper–lined baking sheet (do not use springform pan bottom). Press dough into collar in even 1⁄2-inch-thick layer, smoothing top of dough with back of spoon. Place 2-inch biscuit cutter in center of dough and cut out center. Place extracted round alongside springform collar on baking sheet and replace cutter in center of dough. Open springform collar, but leave it in place.  
3. Bake shortbread 5 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 250 degrees. Continue to bake until edges turn pale golden, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Remove baking sheet from oven; turn off oven. Remove springform pan collar; use chef’s knife to score surface of shortbread into 16 even wedges, cutting halfway through shortbread. Using wooden skewer, poke 8 to 10 holes in each wedge. Return shortbread to oven and prop door open with handle of wooden spoon, leaving 1-inch gap at top. Allow shortbread to dry in turned-off oven until pale golden in center (shortbread should be firm but giving to touch), about 1 hour.  
4. Transfer baking sheet to wire rack; let shortbread cool to room temperature. Cut shortbread at scored marks to separate and serve.  
CHOCOLATE-DIPPED PISTACHIO SHORTBREAD  
Add 1⁄2 cup finely chopped toasted pistachios to dry ingredients in step 1. Bake and cool shortbread as directed. Once shortbread is cool, melt 8 ounces finely chopped bittersweet chocolate in microwave at 50 percent power for 2 minutes. Stir chocolate and continue heating until melted, stirring once every additional minute. Stir in additional 2 ounces finely chopped bittersweet chocolate until smooth. Carefully dip base of each wedge in chocolate, allowing chocolate to come halfway up cookie. Scrape off excess with finger and place on parchment paper–lined rimmed baking sheet. Refrigerate until chocolate sets, about 15 minutes.  
GINGER SHORTBREAD  
Turbinado sugar is commonly sold as Sugar in the Raw. Demerara sugar, sanding sugar, or another coarse sugar can be substituted.  
Add 1⁄2 cup chopped crystallized ginger to dry ingredients in step 1. Sprinkle shortbread with 1 tablespoon turbinado sugar after poking holes in shortbread in step 3.  
TOASTED OAT SHORTBREAD  
To toast the oats, heat them in an 8-inch skillet over medium-high heat until light golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes. We prefer the texture and flavor of a coarse-grained sea salt like Maldon or fleur de sel, but kosher salt can be used.  
Add 1⁄2 cup toasted oats to dry ingredients in step 1. Sprinkle 1⁄2 teaspoon sea salt evenly over surface of dough before baking.  
FORMING AND BAKING SHORTBREAD  
#instructions  
1. Press dough into closed upside-down springform pan collar; smooth with back of spoon. Cut hole in center of dough with 2-inch biscuit cutter; replace cutter in hole.  
2. Open collar. Bake 5 minutes at 450 degrees, then 10 to 15 minutes at 250 degrees.  
3. Score partially baked shortbread into wedges, then poke 8 to 10 holes in each wedge.  
4. Return shortbread to turned-off oven to dry; prop open door with wooden spoon or stick.

SABLÉS (FRENCH BUTTER COOKIES)  
#quantity  
MAKES ABOUT 40 COOKIES  
#ingredients  
Turbinado sugar is commonly sold as Sugar in the Raw. Demerara sugar, sanding sugar, or another coarse sugar can be substituted. Make sure the cookie dough is well chilled and firm so that it can be uniformly sliced.  
1 large egg  
10 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened  
1⁄3 cup plus 1 tablespoon (2-3⁄4 ounces) granulated sugar  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1-1⁄2 cups (7-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1 large egg white, lightly beaten with 1 teaspoon water  
4 teaspoons turbinado sugar  
#instructions  
1. Place egg in small saucepan, cover with water by 1 inch, and bring to boil over high heat. Remove pan from heat, cover, and let sit for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, fill small bowl with ice water. Using slotted spoon, transfer egg to ice water and let stand for 5 minutes. Crack egg and peel shell. Separate yolk from white; discard white. Press yolk through fine-mesh strainer into small bowl.  
2. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter, granulated sugar, salt, and cooked egg yolk on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. Reduce speed to low, add vanilla, and mix until incorporated. Stop mixer; add flour and mix on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds. Using rubber spatula, press dough into cohesive mass.  
3. Divide dough in half. Shape each piece into log about 6 inches long and 1-3⁄4 inches in diameter. Wrap each log in parchment paper and twist ends to seal. Chill dough until firm, about 45 minutes in freezer or 2 hours in refrigerator.  
4. Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Using chef’s knife, slice dough into 1⁄4-inch-thick rounds, rotating dough so that it won’t become misshapen from weight of knife. Place cookies 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Using pastry brush, gently brush cookies with egg white mixture and sprinkle evenly with turbinado sugar.  
5. Bake until centers of cookies are pale golden brown with edges slightly darker than centers, about 15 minutes, switching and rotating baking sheets halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes; transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool to room temperature.  
CHOCOLATE SABLÉS  
Reduce flour to 1-1⁄3 cups and add 1⁄4 cup Dutch-processed cocoa with flour in step 2.  
LEMON SABLÉS  
Add 4 teaspoons grated lemon zest with vanilla in step 2. Omit egg white mixture and turbinado sugar. Once cookies have cooled, dust with confectioners’ sugar.  
TOASTED COCONUT SABLÉS  
Add 1⁄3 cup finely chopped toasted sweetened coconut to dough with flour in step 2. Omit turbinado sugar. After brushing cookies with egg white mixture, sprinkle with 1⁄3 cup finely chopped untoasted sweetened coconut.  
ALMOND SABLÉS  
Substitute 1-1⁄2 teaspoons almond extract for vanilla extract and add 1⁄3 cup finely ground sliced almonds to dough with flour in step 2. Omit turbinado sugar. After brushing cookies with egg white mixture, gently press 3 almond slices in petal shape in center of each cookie.  
CHOCOLATE SANDWICH COOKIES  
In step 4, slice 1 dough log into 1⁄8-inch-thick rounds, omitting egg white mixture and turbinado sugar. Bake cookies as directed in step 5, reducing baking time to 10 to 13 minutes. Repeat with second dough log. When all cookies are completely cool, microwave 3-1⁄2 ounces chopped dark or milk chocolate at 50 percent power for 1 to 2 minutes and let cool slightly. Spread melted chocolate on bottom of 1 cookie. Place second cookie on top, slightly off-center, so some chocolate shows. Repeat with remaining melted chocolate and cookies.  
VANILLA PRETZEL SABLÉS  
Increase vanilla extract to 1 tablespoon and reduce chilling time in step 3 to 30 minutes (dough will not be fully hardened). Slice dough into 1⁄4-inch-thick rounds and roll into balls. Roll each ball into 6-inch rope, tapering ends. Form ropes into pretzel shapes. Proceed with recipe, brushing with egg white mixture, sprinkling with turbinado sugar, and baking as directed.

CHOCOLATE BUTTER COOKIES  
#quantity  
MAKES ABOUT 48 COOKIES  
#ingredients  
Natural cocoa powder will work in this recipe, but we found that Dutch-processed yields the best chocolate flavor. Espresso powder provides complexity, but instant coffee can be substituted in a pinch. The cookies are refined enough to serve plain, although a dusting of sifted confectioners’ sugar or chocolate glaze is a nice touch.  
COOKIES  
20 tablespoons (2-1⁄2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened  
1⁄2 cup (1-1⁄2 ounces) Dutch-processed cocoa  
1 teaspoon instant espresso powder  
1 cup (7 ounces) sugar  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
2 large egg yolks  
1 tablespoon vanilla extract  
2-1⁄4 cups (11-1⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour  
BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE GLAZE (OPTIONAL)  
4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter  
2 tablespoons corn syrup  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE COOKIES: Melt 4 tablespoons butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add cocoa and espresso; stir until mixture forms smooth paste. Set aside to cool, 15 to 20 minutes.  
2. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, mix remaining 16 tablespoons butter, sugar, salt, and cooled cocoa mixture on high speed until well combined and fluffy, about 1 minute, scraping down bowl once or twice with rubber spatula. Add egg yolks and vanilla and mix on medium speed until thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds. Scrape down bowl. With mixer running on low, add flour in 3 additions, waiting until each addition is incorporated before adding next and scraping down bowl after each addition. Continue to mix until dough forms cohesive ball, about 5 seconds. Turn dough onto counter; divide into three 4-inch disks. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate until dough is firm yet malleable, 45 minutes to 1 hour. (Alternatively, shape dough into log, about 12 inches long and 2 inches in diameter; use parchment paper to roll into neat cylinder and twist ends to seal. Chill until very firm and cold, at least 1 hour.)  
3. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, roll 3⁄16 inch thick between 2 large sheets parchment paper. If dough becomes soft and sticky, slide rolled dough on parchment onto baking sheet and refrigerate until firm, about 10 minutes.  
4. Peel parchment from 1 side of dough and cut into desired shapes using cookie cutters; place shapes 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets. (For cylinder-shaped dough, simply slice cookies 1⁄4 inch thick and place on prepared baking sheets.) Bake 1 sheet at a time until cookies show slight resistance to touch, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking; if cookies begin to darken on edges, they have overbaked. (Dough scraps can be patted together, chilled, and rerolled once.) Let cookies cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes; transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool to room temperature. Decorate as desired.  
5. FOR THE GLAZE (OPTIONAL): Melt bittersweet chocolate with butter in heatproof bowl set over saucepan of barely simmering water; whisk until smooth. Add corn syrup and vanilla extract and mix until smooth and shiny. Use back of spoon to spread scant 1 teaspoon glaze almost to edge of each cookie. (If necessary, reheat to prolong fluidity of glaze.) Allow glazed cookies to dry at least 20 minutes.  
GLAZED CHOCOLATE-MINT COOKIES  
Replace vanilla extract with 2 teaspoons mint extract. Glaze cookies with Bittersweet Chocolate Glaze and dry as directed. Melt 1 cup white chocolate chips and drizzle over glazed cookies. Let dry at least 20 minutes before serving.  
MEXICAN CHOCOLATE BUTTER COOKIES  
In medium skillet over medium heat, toast 1⁄2 cup sliced almonds, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, and 1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne until fragrant, about 3 minutes; set aside to cool. In food processor fitted with metal blade, process cooled mixture until very fine, about 15 seconds. Whisk nut-spice mixture into flour before adding flour to dough in step 2. Proceed with recipe, rolling dough into log. Roll chilled log in 1⁄2 cup raw or sanding sugar before slicing.

(Dough can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen up to 2 weeks; defrost in refrigerator before using.)  
3. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, roll 1⁄8 inch thick between 2 large sheets of parchment paper; slide rolled dough, still on parchment, onto baking sheet and refrigerate until firm, about 10 minutes.  
4. Working with 1 sheet of dough at a time, peel parchment from 1 side of dough and cut into desired shapes using cookie cutters; place cookies 1-1⁄2 inches apart on prepared sheets. Bake 1 sheet at a time until cookies are light golden brown, about 10 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. (Dough scraps can be patted together, chilled, and rerolled once.) Let cookies cool on baking sheet for 3 minutes; transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool to room temperature.  
5. FOR THE GLAZE: Whisk cream cheese and 2 tablespoons milk together in medium bowl until combined and no lumps remain.

#ingredients  
If you cannot find superfine sugar, process granulated sugar in a food processor for 30 seconds. If you make these cookies ahead, roll them again in confectioners’ sugar, shaking off the excess, before serving.  
2 cups (8 ounces) pecans or walnuts, chopped fine  
2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
16 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened  
1⁄3 cup (2-1⁄2 ounces) superfine sugar  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
1-1⁄2 cups (6 ounces) confectioners’ sugar

If you plan to decorate your gingerbread cookies and make ornaments out of them, follow the variation for Thin, Crisp Gingerbread Cookies. Because flour is not added during rolling, dough scraps can be rolled and cut as many times as necessary. Don’t overbake the cookies or they will be dry. If you make gingerbread people, this recipe will make about twenty 3-inch people.  
3 cups (15 ounces) all-purpose flour  
3⁄4 cup packed (5-1⁄4 ounces) dark brown sugar  
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon  
1 tablespoon ground ginger  
1⁄2 teaspoon ground cloves  
3⁄4 teaspoon baking soda  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 12 pieces and softened  
3⁄4 cup molasses  
2 tablespoons milk  
#instructions  
1. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, mix flour, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, baking soda, and salt at low speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Stop mixer and add butter pieces; mix at medium-low speed until mixture is sandy and resembles fine meal, about 1-1⁄2 minutes. Reduce speed to low and, with mixer running, gradually add molasses and milk; mix until dough is evenly moistened, about 20 seconds. Increase speed to medium and mix until thoroughly combined, about 10 seconds.  
2. Scrape dough onto counter; divide in half. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, roll 1⁄4 inch thick between 2 large sheets of parchment paper. Leaving dough sandwiched between parchment layers, stack on baking sheet and freeze until firm, 15 to 20 minutes.  
3. Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  
4. Remove 1 dough sheet from freezer; place on counter. Peel off top parchment sheet and gently lay it back in place. Flip dough over; peel off and discard second parchment layer. Cut dough into 5-inch gingerbread people or 3-inch gingerbread people and place them 3⁄4 inch apart on prepared baking sheets; set scraps aside. Repeat with remaining dough. Bake until set in centers and cookies barely retain imprint when touched very gently with fingertip, 8 to 11 minutes, switching and rotating baking sheets halfway through baking. Do not overbake. Let cookies cool on baking sheets for 2 minutes; transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool to room temperature.  
5. Gather scraps; repeat rolling, cutting, and baking in steps 2 and 4. Repeat with remaining dough until all dough is used.  
THIN, CRISP GINGERBREAD COOKIES  
These gingersnap-like cookies are sturdy and therefore suitable for making ornaments. If you wish to thread the cookies, snip wooden skewers to 1⁄2-inch lengths and press them into the cookies just before they go into the oven; remove skewers immediately after baking. Or, use drinking straw to punch holes in the cookies when they’re just out of the oven and still soft. If you make gingerbread people, this recipe will make about thirty 3-inch people.  
Quarter, rather than halve, dough and roll each dough quarter 1⁄8 inch thick, reducing oven temperature to 325 degrees, and baking cookies until slightly darkened and firm in center when pressed with finger, about 15 to 20 minutes.

If using a pastry bag, use a star tip to create the various shapes. For stars, a 1⁄2- to ⁵⁄8-inch tip (measure the diameter of the tip at the smallest point) works best, but for rosettes and S shapes, use a 3⁄8-inch tip. To create stars, hold the bag at a 90-degree angle to baking sheet and pipe the dough straight down, about 1-inch in diameter. To create rosettes, pipe the dough while moving the bag in a circular motion, ending at the center of the rosette; rosettes should be about 1-1⁄4 inches in diameter. To create S shapes, pipe the dough into compact Ss; they should be about 2 inches long and 1 inch wide. If you make an error while piping, the dough can be scraped off the baking sheet and re-piped.  
1 large egg yolk  
1 tablespoon heavy cream  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
16 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened but still cool  
2⁄3 cup (4-2⁄3 ounces) granulated sugar  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk egg yolk, cream, and vanilla in small bowl until combined; set aside.  
2. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter, sugar, and salt at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes, scraping down bowl and beater as needed. With mixer running at medium speed, add yolk mixture and beat until incorporated, about 30 seconds. With mixer running at low speed, gradually beat in flour until combined, scraping down bowl and beater as needed. Give dough final stir to ensure that no flour pockets remain. (Dough can be wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 4 days; before using, let it stand at room temperature until softened, about 45 minutes.)  
3. If using cookie press to form cookies, follow manufacturer’s instructions to fill press. If using pastry bag, fit it with star tip and fill bag with half of dough. Press or pipe cookies onto prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 1-1⁄2 inches apart, refilling cookie press or pastry bag as needed. Bake 1 sheet at a time until cookies are light golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on baking sheet for 10 to 15 minutes; transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool to room temperature.  
SPRITZ COOKIES WITH LEMON ESSENCE  
Add 1 teaspoon juice from 1 lemon to yolk-cream mixture in step 1 and add 1 teaspoon finely grated zest from 1 lemon to butter along with sugar and salt in step 2.  
ALMOND SPRITZ COOKIES  
Pulse 1⁄2 cup sliced almonds and 2 tablespoons of flour in food processor until powdery and evenly fine, about 12 pulses; combine almond mixture with remaining flour. Substitute 3⁄4 teaspoon almond extract for vanilla.  
FILLING A PASTRY BAG AND PIPING SPRITZ COOKIES  
#instructions  
1. Make C-shape with 1 hand and hold piping bag. Fold bag over that hand about halfway down, insert tip, and scrape dough into bag.  
2. When bag is about half full, pull up sides, push down dough, and twist tightly while again pushing down on dough to squeeze out air.  
3. Grab bag at base of twist. Using other hand as guide, hold tip at 90-degree angle about 1⁄2 inch above baking sheet and squeeze to form shape.

Humidity is the archenemy of lace cookies, so try to make them on a dry day. Otherwise, they will absorb too much moisture and be chewy instead of caramelized and brittle.  
3⁄4 cup packed (5-1⁄4 ounces) dark brown sugar  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1⁄2 cup light corn syrup  
1 cup pecans or almonds, chopped fine  
6 tablespoons (1-3⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1 tablespoon heavy cream  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Bring brown sugar, butter, and corn syrup just to boil in medium saucepan over medium heat, 5 to 6 minutes, stirring frequently. Off heat, beat in pecans, flour, cream, vanilla, and salt until smooth.  
2. Drop 6 rounded teaspoons of batter 3 inches apart on each prepared baking sheets. Bake 1 sheet at a time until cookies spread thin, turn deep golden brown, and bubbling has subsided, 6 to 7 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking.  
3. Let cookies cool and firm up slightly on baking sheet for 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to wire rack to cool or shape as desired. Repeat with remaining batter.  
SPICED WALNUT LACE COOKIES  
Substitute 1 cup finely chopped walnuts for pecans and add 1⁄2 teaspoon each ground nutmeg and ground cinnamon and 1⁄4 teaspoon each ground allspice, ground cloves, and ground ginger with vanilla.  
SHAPING LACE COOKIES  
Until you get the hang of shaping these cookies, we recommend baking only two or three at a time. After making each of the shapes below, gently hold the cookie in place until it is set, about 10 seconds, then let cool on a wire rack. If the cookies cool on the cookie sheet too long and become too brittle to shape, place the entire sheet back in the oven for a minute or two until soft again. If any of the cookies shatter after you have shaped them, save the crumbles to sprinkle on ice cream sundaes.  
A. After cooling, slide wide metal spatula under 1 cookie. If it does not bunch or tear, cookies are ready to move.  
B. To make “cigarette” place cookie against handle of wooden spoon and roll cookie over itself as quickly as possible.  
C. To form tuile, lay cookie over rolling pin or wine bottle set on its side so that cookie forms gentle curve.  
D. To form tricornered hat, mold cookie over opening of wine bottle or other bottle of similar shape, then flute edges to form tricornered hat shape. Hold until set.  
E. Cones are easiest shaped by hand. Holding both sides of cookie, wrap 1 side over other, overlapping about 1 inch or so.  
F. To form bowl, lay cookie over bottom of small bowl turned upside down and gently mold cookie to follow contour of bowl.  
DECORATING LACE COOKIES WITH CHOCOLATE  
You can melt about 6 ounces of chopped semisweet chocolate over simmering water or use any glaze of your choice. Rewarm chocolate to restore its fluidity. Lay the cookies on parchment paper to set.  
A. Cigarette shapes or flat cookies may be dipped halfway into glaze.  
B. Flat cookies may be painted with pastry brush or spoon, or you may dip bottom into glaze.  
C. Another option for flat cookies is to place them on sheet of waxed paper, and then drizzle chocolate over them with pastry bag.

#ingredients  
Macaroons must be baked on parchment paper. They will stick to an ungreased sheet and spread on a greased one. You need a slightly less stiff dough if piping the macaroons, so add water, as needed, to make a pipeable paste.  
3 cups (12 ounces) slivered almonds  
1-1⁄2 cups (10-1⁄2 ounces) sugar  
3 large egg whites  
1 teaspoon almond extract  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 325 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  
2. Process almonds in food processor until ground, 1 minute. Add sugar; process 15 seconds longer. Add whites and extract; process just until paste forms. Scrape down bowl and process until stiff but cohesive, malleable paste (similar in consistency to marzipan or pasta dough) forms, about 5 seconds longer. If mixture is crumbly or dry, turn processor back on and add water by drops until proper consistency is reached.  
3. Working with 2 tablespoons of dough at a time, roll dough into balls and space 1-1⁄2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets.  
4. Bake until macaroons are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes, switching and rotating baking sheets halfway through baking. Transfer macaroons, still on parchment (to prevent from tearing), to wire racks and let cool completely.

Make foil sling by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil so that they are as wide as 13 by 9-inch baking pan (one 13-inch sheet and one 9-inch sheet). Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to one another, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Grease foil and set aside.  
2. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in medium bowl until combined; set aside.  
3. Melt chocolate and butter in medium heatproof bowl set over saucepan of barely simmering water, stirring occasionally, until smooth. Off heat, gradually whisk in sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, whisking after each addition, until thoroughly combined. Whisk in vanilla. Add flour mixture in 3 additions, folding with rubber spatula until batter is completely smooth and homogeneous.  
4. Transfer batter to prepared pan; spread batter into corners of pan and smooth surface. Sprinkle toasted nuts, if using, evenly over batter. Bake until toothpick inserted in center of brownies comes out with few moist crumbs attached, 30 to 35 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking. Let brownies cool in pan on wire rack to room temperature, about 2 hours. Remove brownies from pan using foil. Cut brownies into 2-inch squares and serve. (Brownies can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 days.)  
CHOCOLATE-GLAZED MINT-FROSTED BROWNIES  
To melt the chocolate in a microwave, heat it at 50 percent power for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir the chocolate, and continue heating until melted, stirring once every additional minute.  
MINT FROSTING  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened  
2 cups (8 ounces) confectioners’ sugar  
1–2 tablespoons milk  
1 teaspoon mint-flavored extract  
1 recipe CLASSIC BROWNIES  
CHOCOLATE GLAZE  
4 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter  
#instructions  
1. FOR MINT FROSTING: Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter and confectioners’ sugar at low speed until just incorporated, about 30 seconds, then increase speed to medium and beat until smooth and fluffy, about 1-1⁄2 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon milk and mint extract and continue to beat until combined, about 30 seconds, adding up to 1 additional tablespoon milk if necessary to achieve soft spreadable consistency. Using offset spatula, spread mint frosting evenly onto cooled brownies, cover with aluminum foil, and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.  
2. FOR CHOCOLATE GLAZE: Microwave chocolate at 50 percent power for 1 to 2 minutes; stir, add butter, and continue heating until melted, stirring once every additional minute. Set aside to cool slightly, about 10 minutes.  
3. Pour chocolate glaze on frosted brownies; using offset spatula, spread glaze into even layer. Cover with foil and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Remove brownies from pan using foil, cut into 2-inch squares, and serve. (Brownies can be stored in refrigerator for up to 3 days.)  
CLASSIC BROWNIES WITH COCONUT-PECAN TOPPING  
2 large egg yolks  
1⁄2 cup (3-1⁄2 ounces) sugar  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened  
1⁄2 cup heavy cream  
1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1 cup (3 ounces) sweetened shredded coconut  
3⁄4 cup pecans, chopped  
1 recipe CLASSIC BROWNIES  
Whisk egg yolks, sugar, and salt in small saucepan until combined. Whisk in butter, then gradually whisk in heavy cream and vanilla extract. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is fluffy, begins to thicken, and registers about 180 degrees, 8 to 12 minutes. Off heat, stir in coconut and pecans. Spread topping evenly onto cooled brownies, cover with aluminum foil, and refrigerate until set, about 2 hours. Remove brownies from pan using foil, cut into 2-inch squares, and serve. (Brownies can be stored in refrigerator for up to 3 days.)

MAKES 24 BROWNIES  
#ingredients  
For an accurate measurement of boiling water, bring a full kettle of water to a boil, then measure out the desired amount. For the chewiest texture, it is important to let the brownies cool thoroughly before cutting. If your baking dish is glass, cool the brownies 10 minutes, then remove them promptly from the pan (otherwise, the superior heat retention of glass can lead to overbaking). Use high-quality chocolate in this recipe.  
1⁄3 cup (1 ounce) Dutch-processed cocoa  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons instant espresso powder (optional)  
1⁄2 cup plus 2 tablespoons boiling water  
2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped fine  
1⁄2 cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
2 large eggs plus 2 large yolks  
2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
2-1⁄2 cups (17-1⁄2 ounces) sugar  
1-3⁄4 cups (8-3⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt

CREAM CHEESE BROWNIES  
#quantity  
MAKES 16 BROWNIES  
#ingredients  
Knowing when to remove a pan of brownies from the oven is the only difficult part about baking them. If a toothpick inserted in the middle of the pan comes out with fudgy crumbs, remove the pan immediately. If you wait until an inserted toothpick comes out clean, the brownies are overcooked. If you like nuts, you can stir 1 cup toasted walnuts or pecans into the brownie batter. To melt the chocolate in a microwave, heat it at 50 percent power for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir the chocolate, add the butter, and continue heating until melted, stirring once every additional minute.  
BROWNIE BASE  
2⁄3 cup (3-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour

#ingredients  
To drizzle the caramel in step 4, use a 1⁄4-cup dry measuring cup that has been sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. If the caramel is too cool to be fluid, reheat it in the microwave.  
CARAMEL  
1⁄4 cup plus 2 tablespoons heavy cream  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1⁄4 cup water  
2 tablespoons light corn syrup  
1-1⁄4 cups (8-3⁄4 ounces) sugar  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
BROWNIES  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces  
4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped  
2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped  
3⁄4 cup (3-3⁄4 ounces), all-purpose flour  
1⁄2 teaspoon baking powder  
2 large eggs, room temperature  
1 cup (7 ounces) sugar  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
2⁄3 cup chopped pecans  
1⁄3 cup semisweet chocolate chips (optional)  
GARNISH  
25 pecan halves, toasted  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CARAMEL: Combine cream and salt in small bowl; stir well to dissolve salt. Combine water and corn syrup in heavy-bottomed 2- to 3-quart saucepan; pour sugar into center of saucepan, taking care not to let sugar granules touch sides of pan. Gently stir with clean spatula to moisten sugar thoroughly. Cover and bring to boil over medium-high heat; cook, covered and without stirring, until sugar is completely dissolved and liquid is clear, 3 to 5 minutes. Uncover and continue to cook, without stirring, until bubbles show faint golden color, 3 to 5 minutes more. Reduce heat to medium-low. Continue to cook (swirling occasionally) until caramel is light amber and registers about 360 degrees, 1 to 3 minutes longer. Remove saucepan from heat and carefully add cream to center of pan; stir with whisk or spatula (mixture will bubble and steam vigorously) until cream is fully incorporated and bubbling subsides. Stir in butter and vanilla until combined; transfer caramel to microwave-safe measuring cup or bowl and set aside.  
2. FOR THE BROWNIES: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Make foil sling by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil so that they are as wide as 9-inch square baking pan. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to one another, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Grease foil and set aside.  
3. Melt butter, bittersweet chocolate, and unsweetened chocolate in medium heatproof bowl set over saucepan of almost-simmering water, stirring occasionally, until smooth and combined; set aside to cool slightly. Meanwhile, whisk flour and baking powder together in small bowl; set aside. When chocolate has cooled slightly, whisk eggs in large bowl to combine; add sugar, salt, and vanilla and whisk until incorporated. Add melted chocolate mixture to egg mixture; whisk until combined. Add flour mixture; stir with rubber spatula until almost combined. Add chopped pecans and chocolate chips, if using; mix until incorporated and no flour streaks remain.  
4. Transfer half of brownie batter into prepared baking pan, spreading in even layer. Drizzle 1⁄4 cup caramel over batter. Drop remaining batter in large mounds over caramel layer; spread evenly and into corners of pan with rubber spatula. Drizzle 1⁄4 cup caramel over top. Using tip of butter knife, swirl caramel and batter. Bake until toothpick inserted in center of brownies comes out with few moist crumbs attached, 35 to 40 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking. Let brownies cool in pan on wire rack to room temperature, about 1-1⁄2 hours.  
5. Heat remaining caramel (you should have about 3⁄4 cup) in microwave until warm and pourable but still thick (do not boil), 45 to 60 seconds, stirring once or twice; pour caramel over brownies. Spread caramel to cover surface. Refrigerate brownies, uncovered, at least 2 hours.  
6. Remove brownies from pan using foil, loosening sides with paring knife, if needed. Using chef’s knife, cut brownies into 25 evenly sized squares. Press pecan half onto surface of each brownie. Serve chilled or at room temperature. (Brownies can be wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 3 days.)

#ingredients  
This recipe can be made in a stand mixer or a food processor. Frozen raspberries can be substituted for fresh; be sure to defrost them before combining with the raspberry preserves. If your fresh raspberries are very tart, add only 1 or 2 teaspoons of lemon juice to the filling.  
1⁄2 cups (12-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
2⁄3 cup (4-2⁄3 ounces) granulated sugar  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
18 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces and softened  
1⁄4 cup packed (1-3⁄4 ounces) brown sugar  
1⁄2 cup (1-1⁄2 ounces) old-fashioned rolled oats  
1⁄2 cup pecans, chopped fine  
3⁄4 cup (8-1⁄2 ounces) raspberry jam  
3-1⁄2 ounces (3⁄4 cup) fresh raspberries  
1 tablespoon lemon juice  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Make foil sling by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil so that they are as wide as 13 by 9-inch baking pan (one 13-inch sheet and one 9-inch sheet). Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to one another, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Grease foil and set aside.  
2. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, mix flour, granulated sugar, and salt at low speed until combined, about 10 seconds. Add 16 tablespoons butter, 1 piece at a time; then continue mixing until mixture resembles damp sand, 1 to 1-1⁄2 minutes. (If using food processor, process flour, granulated sugar, and salt until combined, about 5 seconds. Scatter 16 tablespoons butter pieces over flour mixture and pulse until mixture resembles damp sand, about 20 pulses.)  
3. Measure 1-1⁄4 cups flour mixture into medium bowl and set aside; distribute remaining flour mixture evenly in bottom of prepared baking pan. Using flat-bottomed measuring cup, firmly press mixture into even layer to form bottom crust. Bake until edges begin to brown, 14 to 18 minutes.  
4. While crust is baking, add brown sugar, oats, and pecans to reserved flour mixture; toss to combine. Work in remaining 2 tablespoons butter by rubbing mixture between fingers until butter is fully incorporated. Pinch mixture with fingers to create hazelnut-size clumps; set streusel aside.  
5. Combine preserves, raspberries, and lemon juice in small bowl; mash with fork until combined but some berry pieces remain.  
6. Spread filling evenly over hot crust; sprinkle streusel topping evenly over filling (do not press streusel into filling). Return pan to oven and bake until topping is deep golden brown and filling is bubbling, 22 to 25 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking. Let cool to room temperature on wire rack, 1 to 2 hours; remove bars from pan using foil. Cut into squares and serve. (Bars are best eaten the day they are baked but can stored at room temperature for up to 3 days; crust and streusel will soften slightly.)

The lemon filling must be added to a warm crust, so be sure to prepare the filling while the crust chills and bakes. Alternatively, you can prepare the filling ahead of time and stir to blend just before pouring it into the crust. Any leftover bars can be sealed in plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 2 days.  
CRUST  
1-3⁄4 cups (8-3⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour  
2⁄3 cup (2-2⁄3 ounces) confectioners’ sugar, plus extra for garnish  
1⁄4 cup cornstarch  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and cut into 1-inch pieces  
LEMON FILLING  
4 large eggs, lightly beaten  
1-1⁄3 cups (9-1⁄3 ounces) granulated sugar  
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour  
2 teaspoons grated lemon zest plus 2⁄3 cup juice (4 lemons)  
1⁄3 cup whole milk  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CRUST: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Make foil sling by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil so that they are as wide as 13 by 9-inch baking pan (one 13-inch sheet and one 9-inch sheet). Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to one another, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Grease foil and set aside.  
2. Process flour, confectioners’ sugar, cornstarch, and salt in food processor until combined, 15 seconds. Add butter and process to blend, 8 to 10 seconds, then pulse until mixture is pale yellow and resembles coarse meal, about 3 pulses. (To do this by hand, mix flour, confectioners’ sugar, cornstarch, and salt in medium bowl. Freeze butter and grate it on large holes of box grater into flour mixture. Toss butter pieces to coat. Rub pieces between fingers for a minute, until flour turns pale yellow and coarse.) Sprinkle mixture into prepared pan and press firmly with fingers into even 1⁄4-inch layer over entire pan bottom and about 1⁄2 inch up sides. Refrigerate for 30 minutes, then bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes.  
3. FOR THE FILLING: Whisk eggs, sugar, and flour in medium bowl, then stir in lemon zest and juice, milk, and salt to blend well.  
4. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees. Stir filling mixture to reblend; pour into warm crust. Bake until filling feels firm when touched lightly, about 20 minutes. Transfer pan to wire rack; let cool to near room temperature, at least 30 minutes. Cut into squares and sieve confectioners’ sugar over squares, if desired. (Bars can be refrigerated for up to 2 days; crust will soften slightly.)

KEY LIME BARS  
#quantity  
MAKES 16 BARS  
#ingredients  
Despite this recipe’s name, we found that most tasters could not tell the difference between bars made with regular supermarket limes (called Persian limes) and true Key limes. Since Persian limes are easier to find and juice, we recommend them. The optional coconut garnish adds textural interest and tames the lime flavor for those who find it too intense. To toast the coconut, spread it out on a rimmed baking sheet on the middle oven rack at 350 degrees, stirring two or three times, until light golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Let cool. The recipe can be doubled and baked in a 13 by 9-inch baking pan; increase the baking times by a minute or two.  
CRUST  
5 ounces animal crackers  
3 tablespoons packed brown sugar  
Pinch salt  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly  
FILLING  
2 ounces cream cheese, room temperature  
1 tablespoon grated lime zest plus 1⁄2 cup juice (4 limes)  
Pinch salt  
1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk  
1 large egg yolk  
GARNISH (OPTIONAL)  
3⁄4 cup (2-1⁄4 ounces) sweetened shredded coconut, toasted until golden and crisp  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Make foil sling by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil so that they are as wide as 8-inch baking pan. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to one another, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Grease foil.  
2. FOR THE CRUST: Pulse animal crackers in food processor until broken down, about 10 pulses; process crumbs until evenly fine, about 10 seconds (you should have about 1-1⁄4 cups crumbs). Add brown sugar and salt; process to combine, 10 to 12 pulses (if large sugar lumps remain, break them apart with your fingers). Drizzle butter over crumbs and pulse until crumbs are evenly moistened with butter, about 10 pulses. Press crumbs evenly and firmly into bottom of prepared pan. Bake until deep golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool on wire rack while making filling. Do not turn off oven.  
3. FOR THE FILLING: While the crust cools, in medium bowl, stir the cream cheese, zest, and salt with rubber spatula until softened, creamy, and thoroughly combined. Add sweetened condensed milk and whisk vigorously until incorporated and no lumps of cream cheese remain; whisk in egg yolk. Add lime juice and whisk gently until incorporated (mixture will thicken slightly).  
4. Pour filling into crust; spread to corners and smooth surface with rubber spatula. Bake until set and edges begin to pull away slightly from sides, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool on wire rack to room temperature, 1 to 1-1⁄2 hours. Cover with foil and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 2 hours.  
5. Remove bars from pan using foil; cut bars into 16 squares. Sprinkle with toasted coconut, if using, and serve. (Bars can be refrigerated for up to 2 days; crust will soften slightly.)  
TRIPLE CITRUS BARS  
Using three types of citrus (orange, lemon, and lime) gives these bars a slightly more complex, floral flavor.  
Substitute 1-1⁄2 teaspoons each grated lime zest, lemon zest, and orange zest for lime zest, and use 6 tablespoons lime juice, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon orange juice in place of all lime juice.

15-MINUTE CHOCOLATE-WALNUT FUDGE  
#quantity  
MAKES ABOUT 2-1⁄2 POUNDS  
#ingredients  
The quality of the chocolate used will affect the flavor and texture of the fudge. We prefer Ghirardelli semisweet and unsweetened chocolate in this recipe. Don’t be tempted to make this fudge without the walnuts; they are crucial to the texture. If you prefer, you can use toasted nuts in this recipe. Make sure to remove the fudge from the double boiler before the chocolate is fully melted. If the chocolate stays in the double boiler too long, there is the possibility of the chocolate separating and producing a greasy fudge. This fudge will change texture and become drier the longer it is stored. If frozen, allow ample time to let it reach room temperature before cutting. This recipe can be easily doubled and prepared in a 13 by 9-inch baking pan.  
1 pound semisweet chocolate, chopped fine  
2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped fine  
1⁄2 teaspoon baking soda  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk  
1 tablespoon vanilla extract  
1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts  
#instructions  
1. Make foil sling by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil so that they are as wide as 13 by 9-inch baking pan (one 13-inch sheet and one 9-inch sheet. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to one another, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Grease foil and set aside.  
2. Mix semisweet chocolate, unsweetened chocolate, baking soda, and salt in medium heatproof bowl until baking soda is evenly distributed. Stir in sweetened condensed milk and vanilla. Set bowl over 4-quart saucepan containing 2 cups simmering water. Stir until chocolate is almost fully melted and few small pieces remain, 2 to 4 minutes.  
3. Remove bowl from heat and continue to stir until chocolate is fully melted and mixture is smooth, about 2 minutes. Stir in walnuts. Transfer fudge to prepared pan and spread in even layer with spatula. Refrigerate until set, about 2 hours. Remove fudge from pan using foil and cut into squares. (Fudge can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks or frozen for up to 3 months.)

PERFECT CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES  
#quantity  
MAKES 24 TRUFFLES  
#ingredients  
These truffles are meant to look like the real thing—small, irregular mounds instead of perfectly spherical balls. If you decide to omit the liquor flavoring, reduce chocolate from 9 to 8 ounces. To melt the chocolate in a microwave, heat it at 50 percent power for about 2 minutes; stir the chocolate and continue heating until melted, stirring once every additional minute. The ganache mixture is quite forgiving. If it cools too much in step 1, place the bowl in a larger pan of warm water and stir the mixture until it has softened and warmed up. If this overwarms the mixture, cool it again as directed. The same flexibility applies if you overwhip the ganache by mistake. Simply warm it over the hot water, cool it, and whip it again. One person alone can dip and coat the truffles, but the process is simpler with a second person to roll coated truffles in cocoa and lift them onto a clean pan.  
GANACHE  
9 ounces semisweet chocolate or bittersweet chocolate, chopped coarse  
1⁄2 cup heavy whipping cream  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1 tablespoon light corn syrup  
2 tablespoons cognac, dark rum, Grand Marnier, framboise, kirsch, Frangelico, amaretto, Kahlúa, or port  
CHOCOLATE AND COCOA COATING  
8 ounces semisweet chocolate or bittersweet chocolate  
2 cups (6 ounces) Dutch-processed cocoa, sifted  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE GANACHE: Melt chocolate in medium heatproof bowl set over pan of almost-simmering water, stirring once or twice, until smooth. Set bowl aside. Bring cream, butter, and corn syrup to simmer (about 160 degrees) in nonreactive pan over low heat. Remove pan from heat, cool for 5 minutes, then whisk into chocolate. Whisk in cognac. Refrigerate mixture until it cools to 80 degrees, 15 to 20 minutes.  
2. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip mixture at medium speed until thickened to a texture like store-bought canned chocolate frosting, 25 to 30 seconds. Spoon ganache into large pastry bag fitted with 1⁄2-inch plain tube. Hold bag perpendicular to pan and with tip about 3⁄4 inch above work surface, pipe 3⁄4-inch mounds (pulling tube away to the side to avoid leaving points) onto parchment-lined baking sheet. Alternatively, scoop mounds with tiny (less than 1 tablespoon) ice cream scoop or melon baller. Refrigerate mounds until hardened, at least an hour.  
3. FOR THE COATING: Melt chocolate in heatproof bowl over almost-simmering water, then cool to 90 degrees. Arrange chilled truffle mounds, bowl of melted chocolate, and high-sided roasting pan filled with cocoa on work surface. Working one mound at a time, dip palm of one hand about 1⁄4-inch deep into melted chocolate, pass one truffle mound with other hand to chocolate-covered hand and close hand around mound to coat, re-dipping hand into chocolate every third or fourth mound. Drop coated truffle into cocoa; roll to coat using fork held in now empty clean hand, leaving truffles in cocoa until chocolate coating has set, about 1 minute. Repeat process until all mounds are in pan of cocoa. Gently roll 5 to 6 truffles at a time in medium strainer to remove excess cocoa, then transfer to serving plate or tightly covered container. (Truffles can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.)  
CHOCOLATE NUT TRUFFLES  
Pulse 1 cup unsalted pistachios, almonds, pecans, or walnuts with 1 tablespoon sugar to a fine powder (about the texture of coarse sand) in food processor, 45 to 60 seconds. Substitute ground nuts for cocoa.  
CHOCOLATE COCONUT TRUFFLES  
Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Spread 1 cup shredded, sweetened coconut in even layer on baking sheet; toast until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes. Substitute toasted coconut for cocoa.

RICH AND TENDER YELLOW LAYER CAKE WITH BUTTERCREAM FROSTING  
#quantity  
SERVES 10 TO 12  
#ingredients  
Adding the butter pieces to the mixing bowl one at a time prevents the dry ingredients from flying up and out of the bowl.  
1⁄2 cup whole milk, room temperature  
4 large eggs, room temperature  
2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
1-3⁄4 cups (7 ounces) cake flour  
1-1⁄2 cups (10-1⁄2 ounces) sugar  
2 teaspoons baking powder  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
16 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 16 pieces and softened  
1 recipe frosting (recipes follow)  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper, grease parchment, and flour pans. Whisk milk, eggs, and vanilla together in small bowl.  
2. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt on low speed until combined. Add butter, 1 piece at a time, and mix until only pea-size pieces remain, about 1 minute.  
3. Add all but 1⁄2 cup milk mixture, increase speed to medium-high, and beat until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to medium-low, add remaining 1⁄2 cup milk mixture, and beat until incorporated, about 30 seconds (batter may look slightly curdled). Give batter final stir by hand.  
4. Divide batter evenly between prepared pans and smooth tops with rubber spatula. Bake cake until toothpick inserted in centers comes out with few crumbs attached, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cakes cool in pans on wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove cakes from pans, discard parchment, and let cool completely, about 2 hours, before frosting. (Cooled cakes can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and kept at room temperature for up to 1 day. Wrapped tightly in plastic, then aluminum foil, cakes can be frozen for up to 1 month. Defrost cakes at room temperature before unwrapping and frosting.)  
5. TO ASSEMBLE THE CAKE: Line edges of cake platter with 4 strips of parchment paper to keep platter clean. Place 1 cake layer on prepared platter. Place about 1-1⁄2 cups frosting in center of cake layer and, using large spatula, spread in even layer right to edge of cake. Place second cake layer on top, making sure layers are aligned, then frost top in same manner as first layer, this time spreading frosting until slightly over edge. Gather more frosting on tip of spatula and gently spread icing onto side of cake. Smooth frosting by gently running edge of spatula around cake and leveling ridge that forms around top edge, or create billows by pressing back of spoon into frosting and twirling spoon as you lift away. Carefully pull out pieces of parchment from beneath cake before serving. (Assembled cake can be refrigerated for up to 1 day. Bring to room temperature before serving.)

VANILLA BUTTERCREAM FROSTING  
#quantity  
MAKES ABOUT 4 CUPS  
#ingredients  
The whole eggs, whipped until airy, give this buttercream a light, satiny-smooth texture that melts on the tongue.  
4 large eggs, room temperature  
1 cup (7 ounces) sugar  
2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
Pinch salt  
1 pound unsalted butter (4 sticks), each stick cut into quarters and softened  
#instructions  
1. Combine eggs, sugar, vanilla, and salt in bowl of stand mixer and set bowl over saucepan containing 1 inch of barely simmering water. Whisking gently but constantly, heat mixture until thin and foamy and registers 160 degrees.  
2. Fit stand mixer with whisk and whip egg mixture on medium-high speed until light, airy, and cooled to room temperature, about 5 minutes. Reduce speed to medium and add butter, 1 piece at a time. (After adding half of butter, buttercream may look curdled; it will smooth with additional butter.) Once all butter is added, increase speed to high and whip until light, fluffy, and thoroughly combined, about 1 minute. (Frosting can be refrigerated for up to 5 days. Let frosting sit at room temperature until softened, about 2 hours, then, using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip on medium speed until smooth, 2 to 5 minutes.)

FLUFFY YELLOW LAYER CAKE WITH CHOCOLATE FROSTING  
#quantity  
SERVES 10 TO 12  
#ingredients  
Bring all the ingredients to room temperature before beginning this recipe. Be sure to use cake pans with at least 2-inch-tall sides. This frosting may be made with milk, semisweet, or bittersweet chocolate; we prefer a frosting made with milk chocolate for this recipe. Cool the chocolate to between 85 and 100 degrees before adding it to the butter mixture.  
CAKE  
2-1⁄2 cups (10 ounces) cake flour  
1-1⁄4 teaspoons baking powder  
1⁄4 teaspoon baking soda  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1-3⁄4 cups (12-1⁄4 ounces) granulated sugar  
10 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled  
1 cup buttermilk, room temperature  
3 tablespoons vegetable oil  
2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
3 large eggs, separated, plus 3 large yolks, room temperature  
Pinch cream of tartar  
FROSTING  
20 tablespoons (2-1⁄2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened  
1 cup (4 ounces) confectioners’ sugar  
3⁄4 cup (2-1⁄4 ounces) Dutch-processed cocoa  
Pinch salt  
3⁄4 cup light corn syrup  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
8 ounces chocolate, melted and cooled  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper, grease parchment, and flour pans. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and 1-1⁄2 cups sugar together in large bowl. In medium bowl, whisk together melted butter, buttermilk, oil, vanilla, and egg yolks.  
2. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip egg whites and cream of tartar on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and whip whites to soft billowy mounds, about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining 1⁄4 cup sugar and whip until glossy, stiff peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to bowl and set aside.  
3. Add flour mixture to now-empty bowl. With mixer on low speed, gradually pour in butter mixture and whip until almost incorporated (a few streaks of dry flour will remain), about 15 seconds. Scrape down bowl, then whip on medium-low speed until smooth and fully incorporated, 10 to 15 seconds.  
4. Using rubber spatula, stir one-third of whites into batter, then add remaining two-thirds whites and gently fold into batter until no white streaks remain. Divide batter evenly between prepared pans, smooth tops with rubber spatula, and gently tap pans on counter to release air bubbles.  
5. Bake cake until toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes. Let cakes cool in pans on wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove cakes from pans, discard parchment, and let cool completely, about 2 hours, before frosting. (Cooled cakes can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and kept at room temperature for up to 1 day. Wrapped tightly in plastic, then aluminum foil, cakes can be frozen for up to 1 month. Defrost cakes at room temperature before unwrapping and frosting.)  
6. FOR THE FROSTING: Process butter, sugar, cocoa, and salt in food processor until smooth, about 30 seconds, scraping down bowl as needed. Add corn syrup and vanilla and process until just combined, 5 to 10 seconds. Scrape down bowl, then add chocolate and process until smooth and creamy, 10 to 15 seconds. (Frosting can be kept at room temperature for up to 3 hours before frosting cake or refrigerated for up to 3 days. If refrigerated, let stand at room temperature for 1 hour before using.)  
7. TO ASSEMBLE THE CAKE: Line edges of cake platter with 4 strips of parchment paper to keep platter clean. Place 1 cake layer on prepared platter. Place about 1-1⁄2 cups frosting in center of cake layer and, using large spatula, spread in even layer right to edge of cake. Place second cake layer on top, making sure layers are aligned, then frost top in same manner as first layer, this time spreading frosting until slightly over edge. Gather more frosting on tip of spatula and gently spread icing onto side of cake. Smooth frosting by gently running edge of spatula around cake and leveling ridge that forms around top edge, or create billows by pressing back of spoon into frosting and twirling spoon as you lift away.

1 cup lemon juice (5 or 6 lemons)  
1-1⁄2 cups (10-1⁄2 ounces) sugar  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
4 large eggs plus 6 large yolks, room temperature (reserve whites for cake)  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces and frozen

4 teaspoons baking powder  
1 teaspoon salt  
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 12 pieces and softened  
1 recipe fluffy icing (recipes follow)  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE FILLING: Sprinkle gelatin over 1 tablespoon lemon juice in small bowl; set aside. Heat remaining lemon juice, sugar, and salt in medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar dissolves and mixture is hot but not boiling. Whisk eggs and egg yolks in large bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly pour hot lemon-sugar mixture into eggs, then return mixture to saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with heatproof spatula, until mixture registers 170 degrees and is thick enough to leave trail when spatula is scraped along pan bottom, 4 to 6 minutes. Immediately remove pan from heat and stir in gelatin mixture until dissolved. Stir in frozen butter until incorporated. Pour filling through fine-mesh strainer into bowl (you should have 3 cups). Place plastic wrap directly on surface of filling; refrigerate until firm enough to spread, at least 4 hours. (Filling can be made up to 1 day in advance and refrigerated; fold with rubber spatula to loosen before spreading onto cake.)  
2. FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper, grease parchment, and flour pans. Whisk milk, egg whites, and vanilla together in 2-cup liquid measuring cup.  
3. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt on low speed until combined. Add butter, 1 piece at a time, and mix until only pea-size pieces remain, about 1 minute. Add all but 1⁄2 cup milk mixture, increase speed to medium-high, and beat until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to medium-low, add remaining 1⁄2 cup milk mixture, and beat until incorporated, about 30 seconds. Give batter final stir by hand.  
4. Divide batter evenly between prepared pans and smooth tops with rubber spatula. Bake cake until toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean, 23 to 25 minutes. Let cakes cool in pans on wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove cakes from pans, discard parchment, and let cool completely, about 2 hours, before frosting. (Cooled cakes can be wrapped tightly in plastic and kept at room temperature for up to 1 day. Wrapped tightly in plastic, then aluminum foil, cakes can be frozen for up to 1 month. Defrost cakes at room temperature before unwrapping and frosting.)  
5. TO ASSEMBLE THE CAKE: Place cooled cake layers on top of each other and make 1⁄8-inch-deep vertical cut into side of each cake layer. With long serrated knife, use sawing motion to cut cakes in half horizontally so that each cake forms 2 layers.  
6. Line edges of cake platter with 4 strips of parchment paper to keep platter clean. Place 1 cake layer on prepared platter. Spread 1 cup lemon filling evenly over top of cake, leaving 1⁄2-inch border around edge. Carefully place second cake layer on top of filling, aligning cuts so that layers are even. Spread 1 cup filling on top; repeat using remaining cake layers and filling. Smooth out any filling that has leaked from sides of cake.  
7. Using spatula, spread icing over top of cake, spreading icing until slightly over edge. Gather more frosting on tip of spatula and gently spread icing onto side of cake. Smooth icing by gently running edge of spatula around cake and leveling ridge that forms around top edge, or create billows by pressing back of spoon into icing and twirling spoon as you lift away.

Be sure to use cream of coconut (such as Coco López) and not coconut milk here. One 15-ounce can is enough for both the cake and the icing; make sure to stir it well before using because it separates upon standing.  
CAKE  
1 large egg plus 5 large whites  
3⁄4 cup cream of coconut  
1⁄4 cup water  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1 teaspoon coconut extract  
2-1⁄4 cups (9 ounces) cake flour  
1 cup (7 ounces) sugar  
1 tablespoon baking powder  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 12 pieces and softened  
3 cups (9 ounces) sweetened shredded coconut  
ICING  
4 large egg whites  
1 cup (7 ounces) sugar  
Pinch salt  
1 pound unsalted butter (4 sticks), each stick cut into 6 pieces and softened  
1⁄4 cup cream of coconut  
1 teaspoon coconut extract  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper, grease parchment, and flour pans.  
2. Whisk egg and egg whites together in 2-cup liquid measuring cup. Add cream of coconut, water, vanilla, and coconut extract and whisk until thoroughly combined.  
3. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt on low speed until combined. Add butter, 1 piece at a time, and mix until only pea-size pieces remain, about 1 minute. Add half of egg mixture, increase speed to medium-high, and beat until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to medium-low, add remaining milk mixture, and beat until incorporated, about 30 seconds. Give batter final stir by hand.  
4. Divide batter evenly between prepared pans and smooth tops with rubber spatula. Bake cake until toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Do not turn off oven. Let cakes cool in pans on wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove cakes from pans, discard parchment, and let cool completely, about 2 hours, before frosting. (Cooled cakes can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and kept at room temperature for up to 1 day. Wrapped tightly in plastic, then aluminum foil, cakes can be frozen for up to 1 month. Defrost cakes at room temperature before unwrapping and frosting.)  
5. While cakes are cooling, spread shredded coconut on rimmed baking sheet; toast in oven until shreds are a mix of golden brown and white, about 15 to 20 minutes, stirring 2 or 3 times. Let cool to room temperature.  
6. FOR THE ICING: Combine egg whites, sugar, and salt in bowl of stand mixer and set over medium saucepan filled with 1 inch of barely simmering water (do not let bottom of bowl touch water). Whisk constantly until mixture is opaque and warm to the touch and registers about 120 degrees, about 2 minutes.  
7. Remove bowl from heat. Fit stand mixer with whisk and whip egg white mixture on high speed until barely warm (about 80 degrees), glossy, and sticky, about 7 minutes. Reduce speed to medium-high and whip in butter, 1 piece at a time, followed by cream of coconut, coconut extract, and vanilla, scraping down bowl as needed. Continue to whip at medium-high speed until combined, about 1 minute.  
8. TO ASSEMBLE THE CAKE: Place cooled cake layers on top of each other and make 1⁄8-inch-deep vertical cut into side of each cake layer. With long serrated knife, use sawing motion to cut cakes in half horizontally so that each cake forms 2 layers.  
9. Line edges of cake platter with 4 strips of parchment paper to keep platter clean. Place 1 cake layer on prepared platter. Place about 3⁄4 cup icing in center of bottom cake layer and, using large spatula, spread in even layer right to edge of cake. Carefully place other cake layer on top of icing, aligning cuts so that layers are even. Repeat using remaining cake layers and more icing, spreading icing until slightly over edge of top layer. Gather more frosting on tip of spatula and gently spread icing onto side of cake. Smooth icing by gently running edge of spatula around cake and leveling ridge that forms around top edge, or create billows by pressing back of spoon into icing and twirling spoon as you lift away. Carefully pull out pieces of parchment from beneath cake before serving. (Assembled cake can be refrigerated for up to 1 day. Bring to room temperature before serving.)  
ASSEMBLING A FOUR-LAYER CAKE  
To create an elegant four-layered cake, you must split two cake layers in half horizontally. If you cut the layers a bit unevenly (which is bound to happen), the cake can lean to one side. Here’s how to compensate for less-than-perfect cutting.  
#instructions  
1. Place cooled cake layers on top of each other and make 1⁄8-inch-deep vertical cut into side of each cake layer.  
2. With long serrated knife, use sawing motion to cut cakes in half horizontally so that each cake forms 2 layers.  
3. Assemble cake, aligning cuts in each layer. Stacking layers in their original orientation conceals uneven cutting.

SERVES 10 TO 12  
#ingredients  
Chill the assembled cake for at least 3 hours to make it easy to cut and serve.  
PASTRY CREAM  
2 cups half-and-half  
6 large egg yolks, room temperature  
1⁄2 cup (3-1⁄2 ounces) sugar  
Pinch salt  
1⁄4 cup (1-1⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces and chilled  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
CAKE  
1-1⁄2 cups (7-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons baking powder  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
3⁄4 cup whole milk  
6 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
3 large eggs, room temperature  
1-1⁄2 cups (10-1⁄2 ounces) sugar  
GLAZE  
1⁄2 cup heavy cream  
2 tablespoons corn syrup  
4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped fine  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE PASTRY CREAM: Heat half-and-half in medium saucepan over medium heat until just simmering. Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks, sugar, and salt in medium bowl until smooth. Add flour to yolk mixture and whisk until incorporated. Remove half-and-half from heat and, whisking constantly, slowly add 1⁄2 cup to yolk mixture to temper. Whisking constantly, return tempered yolk mixture to half-and-half in saucepan.  
2. Return saucepan to medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture thickens slightly, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to simmer, whisking constantly, 8 minutes.  
3. Increase heat to medium and cook, whisking vigorously, until bubbles burst on surface, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat; whisk in butter and vanilla until butter is melted and incorporated. Strain pastry cream through fine-mesh strainer set over medium bowl. Press lightly greased parchment paper directly on surface and refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours.  
4. FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper, grease parchment, and flour pans. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in medium bowl. Heat milk and butter in small saucepan over low heat until butter is melted. Remove from heat, add vanilla, and cover to keep warm.  
5. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip eggs and sugar on high speed until light and airy, about 5 minutes. Remove mixer bowl from stand, add hot milk mixture, and whisk by hand until incorporated. Add dry ingredients and whisk until incorporated.  
6. Working quickly, divide batter evenly between prepared pans and smooth tops with rubber spatula. Bake cakes until tops are light brown and toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes.  
7. Transfer cakes to wire rack and let cool completely in pan, about 2 hours. Run small knife around edge of pans, then invert cakes onto wire rack. Carefully remove parchment, then turn cakes right side up. (Cooled cakes can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and kept at room temperature for up to 1 day. Wrapped tightly in plastic, then aluminum foil, cakes can be frozen for up to 1 month. Defrost cakes at room temperature before unwrapping and frosting.)  
8. TO ASSEMBLE THE CAKE: Line edges of cake platter with 4 strips of parchment paper to keep platter clean. Place 1 cake layer on prepared platter. Whisk pastry cream briefly, then spoon onto center of cake. Using rubber spatula, spread evenly to cake edge. Place second layer on top of pastry cream, bottom side up, making sure layers line up. Press lightly on top of cake to level. Refrigerate cake while preparing glaze.  
9. FOR THE GLAZE: Bring cream and corn syrup to simmer in small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat, add chocolate, and let sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Whisk mixture gently until smooth.  
10. Pour glaze onto center of cake. Use rubber spatula to spread glaze to edge of cake, letting excess drip decoratively down sides. Chill for at least 3 hours. Carefully pull out pieces of parchment from beneath cake before serving. (Assembled cake can be refrigerated for up to 1 day. Bring to room temperature before serving.)

CAKE  
1 cup (7 ounces) sugar  
1-1⁄4 cups (5 ounces) cake flour  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons baking powder  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
5 large eggs (2 whole and 3 separated), room temperature  
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled  
2 tablespoons water  
2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
Pinch cream of tartar  
FILLING  
2 pounds strawberries, hulled (6 cups)  
4–6 tablespoons sugar  
2 tablespoons kirsch  
Pinch salt  
WHIPPED CREAM  
8 ounces cream cheese, room temperature  
1⁄2 cup (3-1⁄2 ounces) sugar  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
2 cups heavy cream, chilled  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Grease 9-inch round cake pan or 9-inch springform pan, line with parchment paper, grease parchment, and flour pan. Reserve 3 tablespoons sugar in small bowl. Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, and remaining sugar in medium bowl. Whisk in 2 whole eggs and 3 egg yolks, butter, water, and vanilla until smooth.  
2. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip egg whites and cream of tartar on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and whip whites to soft billowy mounds, about 1 minute. Gradually add reserved 3 tablespoons sugar and whip until glossy, soft peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir one-third of whites into batter to lighten; add remaining whites and gently fold into batter until no white streaks remain.  
3. Pour batter into prepared pan and smooth top with rubber spatula. Bake cake until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Let cake cool in pan on wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove cake from pan, discard parchment, and let cool completely, about 2 hours, before assembling. (Cooled cake can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and kept at room temperature for up to 1 day. Wrapped tightly in plastic, then aluminum foil, cake can be frozen for up to 1 month. Defrost cake at room temperature before unwrapping and frosting.)  
4. FOR THE FILLING: Halve 24 of best-looking berries and reserve. Quarter remaining berries, toss with 4 to 6 tablespoons sugar (depending on sweetness of berries) in medium bowl, and let sit 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Strain juices from berries and reserve (you should have about 1⁄2 cup). Pulse macerated berries in food processor until coarsely chopped, about 5 pulses (you should have about 1-1⁄2 cups). In small saucepan, simmer reserved juices and kirsch over medium-high heat until syrupy and reduced to about 3 tablespoons, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour reduced syrup over macerated berries, add salt, and toss to combine. Set aside until cake is cooled.  
5. FOR THE WHIPPED CREAM: When cake has cooled, whip cream cheese, sugar, vanilla, and salt using stand mixer fitted with whisk on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. Reduce speed to low and add heavy cream in slow, steady stream; when almost fully combined, increase speed to medium-high and whip until stiff peaks form, 2 to 2-1⁄2 minutes more, scraping down bowl as needed (you should have about 4-1⁄2 cups).  
6. TO ASSEMBLE THE CAKE: Make 1⁄8-inch-deep vertical cut into side of cake. With long serrated knife, use sawing motion to cut cake horizontally into 3 even layers.  
7. Line edges of cake platter with 4 strips of parchment paper to keep platter clean. Place 1 cake layer on prepared platter. Arrange ring of 20 strawberry halves, cut sides down and stem ends facing out, around perimeter of cake layer. Pour half of pureed berry mixture (about 3⁄4 cup) in center, then spread to cover any exposed cake. Gently spread about one-third of whipped cream (about 1-1⁄2 cups) over berry layer, leaving 1⁄2-inch border around edge. Place next cake layer on top and press down gently (whipped cream layer should become flush with cake edge). Repeat with 20 strawberry halves, remaining berry mixture, and half of remaining whipped cream; gently press last cake layer on top. Spread remaining whipped cream over top and decorate with remaining 8 strawberry halves. Carefully pull out pieces of parchment from beneath cake before serving. (Assembled cake can be refrigerated for up to 4 hours.)

OLD-FASHIONED CHOCOLATE LAYER CAKE  
#quantity  
SERVES 10 TO 12  
#ingredients  
For a smooth, spreadable frosting, use chopped semisweet chocolate, not chocolate chips—chocolate chips contain less cocoa butter than bar chocolate and will not melt as readily. As for other bar chocolate, bittersweet chocolate that is 60 percent cacao can be substituted but it will produce a stiffer, although still spreadable, frosting. Bittersweet chocolate with 70 percent cacao, however, should be avoided—it will produce a frosting that is crumbly and will not spread. For best results, do not make the frosting until the cakes are cooled, and use the frosting as soon as it is ready. If the frosting gets too cold and stiff to spread easily, wrap the mixer bowl with a kitchen towel soaked in hot water and mix on low speed until the frosting appears creamy and smooth. Be sure to use cake pans with at least 2-inch-tall sides.  
CAKE  
4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped coarse  
1⁄4 cup (3⁄4 ounce) Dutch-processed cocoa  
1⁄2 cup hot water  
1-3⁄4 cups (12-1⁄4 ounces) sugar  
1-3⁄4 cups (8-3⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons baking soda  
1 teaspoon salt  
1 cup buttermilk  
2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
4 large eggs plus 2 large yolks, room temperature  
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 12 pieces and softened  
FROSTING  
1 pound semisweet chocolate, chopped fine  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1⁄3 cup (2-1⁄3 ounces) sugar  
2 tablespoons corn syrup  
2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1-1⁄4 cups heavy cream, chilled  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper, grease parchment, and flour pans. Combine chocolate, cocoa, and hot water in medium heatproof bowl set over saucepan filled with 1 inch of barely simmering water and stir with heatproof rubber spatula until chocolate is melted, about 2 minutes. Add 1⁄2 cup sugar to chocolate mixture and stir until thick and glossy, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove bowl from heat; set aside to cool.  
2. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt together in medium bowl. Combine buttermilk and vanilla in small bowl. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip eggs and egg yolks on medium-low speed until combined, about 10 seconds. Add remaining 1-1⁄4 cups sugar, increase speed to high, and whip until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Replace whisk with paddle. Add cooled chocolate mixture to egg mixture and mix on medium speed until thoroughly combined, 30 to 45 seconds, scraping down bowl as needed. Add butter, 1 piece at a time, mixing about 10 seconds after each addition. Add flour in 3 additions, alternating with 2 additions of buttermilk mixture, mixing until incorporated after each addition (about 15 seconds), scraping down bowl as needed (batter may appear curdled). Mix at medium-low speed until batter is thoroughly combined, about 15 seconds. Remove bowl from mixer and give batter final stir by hand.  
3. Divide batter evenly between prepared pans and smooth tops with rubber spatula. Bake cake until toothpick inserted in centers comes out with few crumbs attached, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cakes cool in pans on wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove cakes from pans, discard parchment, and let cool completely, about 2 hours, before frosting. (Cooled cakes can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and kept at room temperature for up to 1 day. Wrapped tightly in plastic, then aluminum foil, cakes can be frozen for up to 1 month. Defrost cakes at room temperature before unwrapping and frosting.)  
4. FOR THE FROSTING: Melt chocolate in heatproof bowl set over saucepan containing 1 inch of barely simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat and set aside. Meanwhile, melt butter in small saucepan over medium-low heat. Increase heat to medium, add sugar, corn syrup, vanilla, and salt and stir with heatproof rubber spatula until sugar is dissolved, 4 to 5 minutes. In bowl of stand mixer, combine melted chocolate, butter mixture, and cream and stir until thoroughly combined.  
5. Place mixer bowl over ice bath and stir mixture constantly with rubber spatula until frosting is thick and just beginning to harden against sides of bowl, 1 to 2 minutes (frosting should be 70 degrees). Fit stand mixer with paddle and beat frosting on medium-high speed until frosting is light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Using rubber spatula, stir until completely smooth.  
6. TO ASSEMBLE THE CAKE: Line edges of cake platter with 4 strips of parchment paper to keep platter clean. Place 1 cake layer on prepared platter. Place about 1-1⁄2 cups frosting in center of cake layer and, using large spatula, spread in even layer right to edge of cake. Place second cake layer on top, making sure layers are aligned, then frost top in same manner as first layer, this time spreading frosting until slightly over edge. Gather more frosting on tip of spatula and gently spread icing onto side of cake. Smooth frosting by gently running edge of spatula around cake and leveling ridge that forms around top edge, or create billows by pressing back of spoon into frosting and twirling spoon as you lift away. Carefully pull out pieces of parchment from beneath cake before serving. (Assembled cake can be refrigerated for up to 1 day. Bring to room temperature before serving.)

SERVES 10 TO 12  
#ingredients  
If using 9-inch cake pans, note that the layers will be quite thin. For an accurate measurement of boiling water, bring a full kettle of water to a boil, then measure out the desired amount.  
1⁄2 cup (1-1⁄2 ounces) Dutch-processed cocoa, plus extra as needed  
1-1⁄2 cups (7-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1 teaspoon baking soda  
1⁄2 teaspoon baking powder  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1-1⁄4 cups boiling water  
4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped  
1 teaspoon instant espresso powder or instant coffee  
10 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened  
1-1⁄2 cups packed (10-1⁄2 ounces) light brown sugar  
3 large eggs, room temperature  
1⁄2 cup sour cream, room temperature  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1 recipe VANILLA BUTTERCREAM FROSTING  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease three 8- or 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper, grease parchment, then dust with cocoa. Whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in large bowl. In medium bowl, whisk boiling water, chocolate, 1⁄2 cup cocoa, and instant espresso together until smooth.  
2. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter and sugar together on medium speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 6 minutes. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, until combined, about 30 seconds. Beat in sour cream and vanilla until incorporated.  
3. Reduce speed to low and add flour in 3 additions, alternating with 2 additions of chocolate mixture, scraping down bowl as needed (do not overbeat). Give batter final stir by hand.  
4. Divide batter evenly among prepared pans, smooth tops with rubber spatula, and gently tap pans on the counter to release air bubbles. Bake cake until toothpick inserted in centers comes out with few crumbs attached, 15 to 20 minutes, switching position of pans twice through baking, so each cake spends same amount of time in each position.  
5. Let cakes cool in pans on wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove cakes from pans, discard parchment, and let cool completely, about 2 hours, before frosting. (Cooled cakes can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and kept at room temperature for up to 1 day. Wrapped tightly in plastic, then aluminum foil, cakes can be frozen for up to 1 month. Defrost cakes at room temperature before unwrapping and frosting.)  
6. TO ASSEMBLE THE CAKE: Line edges of cake platter with 4 strips of parchment paper to keep platter clean. Place 1 cake layer on prepared platter. Place about 1 cup frosting in center of cake layer and, using large spatula, spread in even layer right to edge of cake. Repeat with second and third layer, spreading frosting on top layer until slightly over edge. Gather more frosting on tip of spatula and gently spread icing onto side of cake. Smooth frosting by gently running edge of spatula around cake and leveling ridge that forms around top edge, or create billows by pressing back of spoon into frosting and twirling spoon as you lift away. Carefully pull out pieces of parchment from beneath cake before serving. (Assembled cake can be refrigerated for up to 1 day. Bring to room temperature before serving.)

GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE WITH COCONUT-PECAN FILLING  
#quantity  
SERVES 10 TO 12  
#ingredients  
For an accurate measurement of boiling water, bring a full kettle of water to a boil, then measure out the desired amount. When you assemble the cake, the filling should be cool or cold (or room temperature, at the very warmest). To be time-efficient, first make the filling, then use the refrigeration time to prepare, bake, and cool the cakes. The toasted pecans are stirred into the filling just before assembly to keep them from becoming soft and soggy. Be sure to use cake pans with at least 2-inch-tall sides.  
FILLING  
4 large egg yolks, room temperature  
1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk  
1 cup (7 ounces) granulated sugar  
1⁄4 cup packed (1-3⁄4 ounces) light brown sugar  
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 6 pieces  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
2-1⁄3 cups (7 ounces) sweetened shredded coconut  
1-1⁄2 cups (6 ounces) pecans, toasted and chopped fine  
CAKE  
4 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, chopped fine  
1⁄4 cup (3⁄4 ounce) Dutch-processed cocoa  
1⁄2 cup boiling water  
2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour  
3⁄4 teaspoon baking soda  
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened  
1 cup (7 ounces) granulated sugar  
2⁄3 cup packed (4-2⁄3 ounces) light brown sugar  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
4 large eggs, room temperature  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
3⁄4 cup sour cream, room temperature  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE FILLING: Whisk egg yolks in medium saucepan, then gradually whisk in evaporated milk. Add granulated sugar, brown sugar, butter, and salt and cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until mixture is boiling, frothy, and slightly thickened, about 6 minutes. Transfer mixture to bowl, whisk in vanilla, then stir in coconut. Cool until just warm, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until cool or cold, at least 2 hours or up to 3 days. (Do not stir in pecans until just before cake assembly.)  
2. FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper, grease parchment, and flour pans. Combine chocolate and cocoa in small heatproof bowl, pour boiling water over mixture, and let sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Whisk mixture gently until smooth, then let cool to room temperature. Whisk flour and baking soda together in medium bowl and set aside.  
3. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and salt on medium-high until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, and beat until combined. Beat in vanilla, increase speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, about 45 seconds. Reduce speed to low, add chocolate, then increase speed to medium and beat until combined, about 30 seconds, scraping down bowl once (batter may appear curdled). Reduce speed to low, add flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with 2 additions of sour cream, scraping down bowl as needed. Give batter final stir by hand (batter will be thick).  
4. Divide batter evenly between prepared pans and smooth tops with rubber spatula. Bake cake until toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean, about 30 minutes, switching position of pans twice through baking, so each cake spends same amount of time in each position. Let cakes cool in pans on wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove cakes from pans, discard parchment, and let cool completely, about 2 hours, before filling. (Cooled cakes can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and kept at room temperature for up to 1 day. Wrapped tightly in plastic, then aluminum foil, cakes can be frozen for up to 1 month. Defrost cakes at room temperature before unwrapping and frosting.)  
5. TO ASSEMBLE THE CAKE: Place cooled cake layers on top of each other and make 1⁄8-inch-deep vertical cut into side of each cake layer. With long serrated knife, use sawing motion to cut cakes in half horizontally so that each cake forms two layers.  
6. Line edges of cake platter with 4 strips of parchment paper to keep platter clean. Place 1 cake layer on prepared platter. Stir toasted pecans into chilled filling. Spread 1 cup filling evenly across top of cake layer, spreading filling to very edge. Carefully place next cake layer on top of filling, aligning cuts so that layers are even. Repeat using remaining filling and cake layers. Carefully pull out pieces of parchment from beneath cake before serving. (Assembled cake can be refrigerated for up to 1 day. Bring to room temperature before serving.)  
GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE WITH BANANA, MACADAMIA, AND COCONUT FILLING  
If you cannot find roasted unsalted macadamia nuts, substitute salted ones, but first remove excess salt by spreading them on a clean kitchen towel and giving them a good rub.  
Reduce vanilla in filling to 1 teaspoon and add 2 teaspoons dark rum with vanilla in step 1. Substitute unsalted macadamia nuts for pecans. Just before assembling cake, peel and cut 4 bananas into 3⁄8-inch-thick slices. Arrange one quarter of banana slices on first cake layer, then spread filling evenly over; repeat with remaining cake layers, bananas, and filling.  
GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE WITH COFFEE, CASHEW, AND COCONUT FILLING  
Add 2 teaspoons ground coffee to filling mixture with sugars in step 1. Substitute roasted unsalted cashews for pecans.

The towering layers of chocolate cake separated by coconut-pecan filling look impressive in our German Chocolate Cake, but splitting the cake layers and assembling the cake is a fair amount of work, so we developed this simplified sheet cake variation, which slathers the entire cake with a thick layer of the coconut-pecan filling. In addition to being easier to assemble, the cake is also a cinch to serve to crowds. When you frost the cake, the frosting should be cool or cold (or room temperature, at the very warmest). To be time-efficient, first make the frosting, then use the refrigeration time to prepare, bake, and cool the cake. The toasted pecans are stirred into the frosting just before the cake is frosted to keep them from becoming soft and soggy.  
Grease 13 by 9-inch baking pan, line with parchment paper, grease parchment, and flour pan. Follow recipe as directed through step 3, preparing filling to use as frosting. In step 4, pour batter into prepared pan, smooth top with rubber spatula, and gently tap pan on counter to release air bubbles. Bake cake until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cake cool in pan on wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove cake from pan, discard parchment, and let cool completely, about 2 hours, before frosting. Frost top of cake and serve. (Refrigerate cake if not serving immediately; if refrigerated longer than 2 hours, let cake sit at room temperature 15 to 20 minutes before serving. Cooled, unfrosted cake can be stored at room temperature for up to 1 day. Frosted cake can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.)

2 tablespoons all-purpose flour  
Confectioners’ sugar or cocoa (optional)  
WHIPPED CREAM (optional)  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Grease eight 6-ounce ramekins and dust with flour or cocoa. Arrange ramekins on rimmed baking sheet. Melt butter and chocolate in medium heatproof bowl set over saucepan filled with 1 inch of barely simmering water, stirring once or twice, until smooth. Remove from heat.  
2. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip eggs, egg yolk, sugar, vanilla, and salt on high speed until volume nearly triples, color is very light, and mixture drops from beaters in smooth, thick stream, about 5 minutes.  
3. Scrape egg mixture over chocolate mixture, then sprinkle flour on top. Gently fold egg mixture and flour into chocolate until mixture is uniformly colored. Ladle or pour batter into prepared ramekins. (Unbaked cakes can be refrigerated for up to 8 hours. Return to room temperature for 30 minutes before baking.)  
4. Bake until cakes have puffed about 1⁄2 inch above rims of ramekins, have thin crust on top, and jiggle slightly at center when ramekins are shaken very gently, 12 to 13 minutes. Run knife around inside edges of ramekins to loosen cakes, invert onto individual serving plates, and let sit until cakes release themselves from ramekins, about 1 minute. Lift off ramekins, dust with confectioners’ sugar, if using, and/or dollop with whipped cream, if using, and serve.  
ORANGE FALLEN CHOCOLATE CAKES  
Fold 1 tablespoon grated orange zest and 2 tablespoons orange liqueur into beaten egg and melted chocolate mixture with flour in step 3.  
FALLEN CHOCOLATE CAKE  
One large fallen chocolate cake can be prepared in a springform pan. Do not use a regular cake pan, as the cake will be impossible to remove once baked. Though the cake is best when served warm (within about 30 minutes of being unmolded), it can be held in the pan for up to 2 hours before serving.  
Substitute greased 8- or 9-inch springform pan for ramekins. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees and bake until cake looks puffed, thin top crust has formed, and center jiggles slightly when pan is shaken gently, 22 to 25 minutes for 9-inch pan or 27 to 30 minutes for 8-inch pan. Let cake cool for 15 minutes, then run thin knife between cake and sides of pan and remove sides of pan. Sprinkle with confectioners’ sugar, if using, and/or dollop with whipped cream, if using, and serve.

THE ULTIMATE FLOURLESS CHOCOLATE CAKE  
#quantity  
SERVES 12 TO 16  
#ingredients  
Even though the cake may not look done, pull it from the oven when it registers 140 degrees. It will continue to firm up as it cools. If you use a 9-inch springform pan instead of the preferred 8-inch, reduce the baking time to 18 to 20 minutes.  
8 large eggs, chilled  
1 pound bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped coarse  
16 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces  
1⁄4 cup strong brewed coffee, room temperature  
Confectioners’ sugar or cocoa  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Grease 8-inch springform pan, line with parchment paper, then grease sides. Wrap outside of pan with two 18-inch-square pieces of aluminum foil; set in roasting pan. Bring kettle of water to boil.  
2. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip eggs on medium speed until doubled in volume, about 5 minutes.  
3. Meanwhile, melt chocolate with butter and coffee in large heatproof bowl set over saucepan filled with 1 inch of barely simmering water, stirring once or twice until smooth and very warm (should register about 115 degrees). Using large rubber spatula, fold one-third of egg foam into chocolate mixture until few streaks of egg are visible. Fold in remaining foam in 2 additions until mixture is totally homogeneous.  
4. Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth top with rubber spatula. Set roasting pan on oven rack and pour enough boiling water into roasting pan to come about halfway up sides of springform pan. Bake until cake has risen slightly, edges are just beginning to set, thin glazed crust (like a brownie crust) has formed on surface, and cake registers 140 degrees, 22 to 25 minutes. Remove cake pan from water bath and set on wire rack; let cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate overnight. (Cake can be refrigerated for up to 4 days).  
5. About 30 minutes before serving, run thin knife between cake and sides of pan; remove sides of pan. Invert cake onto sheet of waxed paper, discard parchment, and turn cake right side up onto serving platter. Dust with confectioners’ sugar, if using, and serve.

SERVES 12 TO 16  
#ingredients  
Be sure to use cake pans with at least 2-inch-tall sides.  
CAKE AND FILLING  
8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped fine  
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces  
2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
1⁄4 teaspoon instant espresso powder  
1-3⁄4 cups (6-1⁄8 ounces) sliced almonds, toasted  
1⁄4 cup (1-1⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
5 large eggs, room temperature  
3⁄4 cup (5-1⁄4 ounces) sugar  
FILLING  
2-1⁄2 ounces (1⁄2 cup) raspberries, plus 16 individual raspberries  
1⁄4 cup seedless raspberry jam  
GLAZE  
5 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped fine  
1⁄2 cup plus 1 tablespoon heavy cream  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper, grease parchment, and flour pans. Melt chocolate and butter in large heatproof bowl set over saucepan filled with 1 inch of barely simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Stir in vanilla and espresso.  
2. Pulse 3⁄4 cup almonds in food processor until coarsely chopped, 6 to 8 pulses, and set aside. Process remaining 1 cup almonds until very finely ground, about 45 seconds. Add flour and salt and continue to process until combined, about 15 seconds. Transfer almond-flour mixture to medium bowl. Process eggs until lightened in color and almost doubled in volume, about 3 minutes. With processor running, slowly add sugar and process until thoroughly combined, about 15 seconds. Using whisk, gently fold egg mixture into chocolate mixture until some streaks of egg remain. Sprinkle half almond-flour mixture over chocolate mixture and gently whisk until just combined. Sprinkle with remaining almond-flour mixture and gently whisk until just combined.  
3. Divide batter evenly between prepared pans and smooth tops with rubber spatula. Bake cakes until centers are firm and toothpick inserted in centers comes out with few moist crumbs attached, 14 to 16 minutes. Transfer cakes to wire rack and let cool completely in pans, about 30 minutes.  
4. Run paring knife around sides of cakes to loosen and invert cakes onto cardboard rounds cut same size as diameter of cake; discard parchment. Using wire rack, turn 1 cake right side up, then slide from rack back onto cardboard round.  
5. FOR THE FILLING: Place 1⁄2 cup raspberries in medium bowl and coarsely mash with fork. Stir in raspberry jam until just combined.  
6. TO ASSEMBLE THE TORTE: Spread raspberry mixture onto cake layer that is right side up. Top with second cake layer, leaving it upside down. Transfer assembled cake, still on cardboard round, to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet.  
7. FOR THE GLAZE: Melt chocolate and cream in medium heatproof bowl set over saucepan filled with 1 inch of barely simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat and gently whisk until very smooth. Pour glaze onto center of assembled cake. Using offset spatula, spread glaze evenly over top of cake, letting it drip down sides. Spread glaze along sides of cake to coat evenly.  
8. Using fine-mesh strainer, sift reserved almonds to remove any fine bits. Holding bottom of cake on cardboard round with 1 hand, gently press sifted almonds onto cake sides with other hand. Arrange remaining 16 raspberries around circumference. Refrigerate cake on rack until glaze is set, at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours (if refrigerating cake for more than 1 hour, let sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes before serving). Transfer cake to serving platter and serve.  
ASSEMBLING CHOCOLATE RASPBERRY TORTE  
This approach creates a torte with a perfectly flat bottom and top.  
#instructions  
1. Run paring knife around sides of cakes and invert layers onto cardboard rounds cut same size as diameter of cake, then remove parchment paper.  
2. Using wire rack, turn 1 cake right side up, then slide from wire rack back onto cardboard round.  
3. Spread raspberry filling over cake layer that is right side up.  
4. Top with second cake, leaving bottom facing up, then use offset spatula to evenly spread glaze over top and sides.

RUSTIC PLUM CAKE  
#quantity  
SERVES 8  
#ingredients  
This recipe works best with Italian plums, which are also called prune plums. If substituting regular red or black plums, use an equal weight of plums, cut them into eighths, and stir them a few times while cooking. Arrange slices, slightly overlapped, in two rings over surface of cake. Do not use canned Italian plums. Don’t add the leftover plum cooking liquid to the cake before baking; reserve it and serve with the finished cake (or reserve for serving over ice cream). The cake can be served with WHIPPED CREAM.  
2 tablespoons red currant jelly or seedless raspberry jam  
3 tablespoons brandy  
1 pound Italian prune plums, halved and pitted  
3⁄4 cup (5-1⁄4 ounces) sugar  
1⁄3 cup slivered almonds  
3⁄4 cup (3-3⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄2 teaspoon baking powder

1. Cook jelly and brandy in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until thick and syrupy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and place plums cut side down in syrup. Return skillet to medium heat and cook, shaking pan to prevent plums from sticking, until plums release their juices and liquid reduces to thick syrup, about 5 minutes. Let plums cool in skillet, about 20 minutes.  
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour 9-inch springform pan. Process sugar and almonds in food processor until nuts are finely ground, about 1 minute. Add flour, baking powder, and salt and pulse to combine, about 5 pulses. Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse sand, about 10 pulses. Add egg, egg yolk, vanilla, and almond extract, if using, and process until smooth, about 5 seconds, scraping down bowl if needed (batter will be very thick and heavy).  
3. Pour batter into prepared pan and smooth top with rubber spatula. Stir plums to coat with syrup. Arrange plum halves, skin side down, evenly over surface of batter. Bake until cake is golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out with few crumbs attached, 40 to 50 minutes. Run thin knife around sides of cake to loosen. Cool in pan on wire rack until just warm or to room temperature, at least 30 minutes. Run thin knife between cake and sides of pan; remove sides of pan. Dust with confectioners’ sugar and serve.

PINEAPPLE UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE  
#quantity  
SERVES 8  
#ingredients  
For this recipe, we prefer to use a 9-inch cake pan with sides that are at least 2 inches high. Alternatively, a 10-inch ovensafe skillet (cast iron or stainless steel) can be used to both cook the pineapple and bake the cake. If using a skillet instead of a cake pan, cool the juices directly in the skillet while making the batter; it’s fine if the skillet is warm when the batter is added.  
TOPPING  
1 pineapple, peeled, cored, and cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces (4 cups)  
1 cup packed (7 ounces) light brown sugar  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
CAKE  
1-1⁄2 cups (7-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons baking powder  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened  
3⁄4 cup (5-1⁄4 ounces) granulated sugar  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
2 large eggs plus 1 large white, room temperature  
1⁄3 cup whole milk, room temperature  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease 9-inch round cake pan, line with parchment paper, grease parchment, and flour pan.  
2. FOR THE TOPPING: Cook pineapple and brown sugar in 10-inch skillet over medium heat until pineapple is translucent and has light brown hue, 15 to 18 minutes, stirring occasionally during first 5 minutes. Transfer fruit and juices to fine-mesh strainer set over bowl (you should have about 2 cups cooked fruit). Return juices to skillet and simmer over medium heat until thickened, beginning to darken, and mixture forms large bubbles, 6 to 8 minutes, adding any more juices released by fruit to skillet after about 4 minutes. Off heat, whisk in butter and vanilla. Pour caramel mixture into prepared cake pan and set aside while preparing cake. (Pineapple will continue to release liquid as it sits; do not add this liquid to already-reduced juice mixture.)  
3. FOR THE CAKE: Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in medium bowl. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter and sugar on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce speed to medium, add vanilla, and beat to combine. Increase speed to medium-high, add eggs and egg white, 1 at a time, and beat until combined. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with 2 additions of milk, scraping down bowl as needed (batter will be thick). Give batter final stir by hand.  
4. Working quickly, distribute drained pineapple in cake pan in even layer, gently pressing fruit into caramel. Using rubber spatula, drop mounds of batter over fruit, then spread batter over fruit and to sides of pan in even layer. Gently tap pan on counter to release air bubbles. Bake cake until golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool 10 minutes on wire rack, then place inverted serving platter over cake pan. Invert cake pan and platter together, then remove pan. Let cool to room temperature, about 2 hours, and serve.  
ORANGE-CARDAMOM PINEAPPLE UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE  
Add 1 tablespoon grated orange zest to skillet with pineapple in step 2, and add 1⁄4 cup orange juice to skillet in step 2 after draining pineapple and returning juices to skillet. Whisk 3⁄4 teaspoon ground cardamom into flour mixture in step 3.

OATMEAL CAKE WITH BROILED ICING  
#quantity  
SERVES 8  
#ingredients  
Do not use old-fashioned or instant oats for this recipe. Be sure to use a metal baking pan; glass pans are not recommended when broiling. If you have a drawer-style broiler (underneath the oven), position the rack as far as possible from the broiler element and monitor the icing carefully as it cooks in step 5. A vertical sawing motion with a serrated knife works best for cutting through the crunchy icing and tender cake.  
CAKE  
1 cup (3 ounces) quick oats  
3⁄4 cup water, room temperature  
3⁄4 cup (3-3⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄2 teaspoon baking soda  
1⁄2 teaspoon baking powder  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
1⁄4 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
1⁄8 teaspoon ground nutmeg  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened  
1⁄2 cup (3-1⁄2 ounces) granulated sugar  
1⁄2 cup packed (3-1⁄2 ounces) light brown sugar  
1 large egg, room temperature  
1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
ICING  
1⁄4 cup packed (1-3⁄4 ounces) light brown sugar  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled  
3 tablespoons milk  
3⁄4 cup (2-1⁄4 ounces) sweetened shredded coconut  
1⁄2 cup pecans, chopped  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Make foil sling by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil so that they are as wide as 8-inch square baking pan. Lay sheets of foil in pan, perpendicular to one another, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Spray foil with vegetable oil spray.  
2. Combine oats and water in medium bowl and let sit until water is absorbed, about 5 minutes. In another medium bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together.  
3. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar on medium speed until combined and mixture has consistency of damp sand, 2 to 4 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. Add egg and vanilla and beat until combined. Add flour mixture in 2 additions and mix until just incorporated, about 30 seconds. Add soaked oats and mix until combined, about 15 seconds. Give batter final stir by hand.  
4. Scrape batter into prepared pan, smooth top with rubber spatula, and gently tap on counter to release air bubbles. Bake cake until toothpick inserted in center comes out with few crumbs attached, 30 to 35 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking. Let cake cool slightly in pan, at least 10 minutes.  
5. FOR THE BROILED ICING: While cake cools, adjust oven rack 9 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. In medium bowl, whisk together brown sugar, melted butter, and milk, then stir in coconut and pecans. Spread mixture evenly over warm cake. Broil until topping is bubbling and golden, 3 to 5 minutes.  
6. Let cake cool in pan on wire rack for 1 hour. Remove cake from pan using foil and transfer to platter. Gently push side of cake with knife and remove foil, 1 piece at a time. Serve.

SERVES 8  
#ingredients  
The butter and eggs should be the first ingredients prepared so they have a chance to stand at room temperature and lose their chill while the oven heats, the loaf pan is greased and floured, and the other ingredients are measured. The test kitchen’s preferred loaf pan measures 8-1⁄2 by 4-1⁄2 inches; if you use a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan, start checking for doneness 5 minutes earlier than advised in the recipe.  
16 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 16 pieces and chilled  
3 large eggs plus 3 large yolks, room temperature  
2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
1-3⁄4 cups (7 ounces) cake flour  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
1-1⁄4 cups (8-3⁄4 ounces) sugar  
#instructions  
1. Place butter in bowl of stand mixer; let stand at room temperature 20 to 30 minutes to soften slightly (butter should reach no more than 60 degrees). Using dinner fork, beat eggs, egg yolks, and vanilla in 4-cup liquid measuring cup until combined. Let egg mixture stand at room temperature until ready to use.  
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Grease and flour 8-1⁄2 by 4-1⁄2-inch loaf pan.  
3. Fit stand mixer with paddle and beat butter and salt at medium-high speed until shiny, smooth, and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes, scraping down bowl once. Reduce speed to medium and gradually pour in sugar (this should take about 1 minute). Once all sugar is added, increase speed to medium-high and beat until mixture is light and fluffy, 5 to 8 minutes, scraping down bowl once. Reduce speed to medium and gradually add egg mixture in slow, steady stream (this should take 1 to 1-1⁄2 minutes). Scrape down bowl, then beat mixture at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes (batter may look slightly curdled). Remove bowl from mixer and scrape down bowl.  
4. Sift flour over butter-egg mixture in 3 additions, folding gently with rubber spatula until combined after each addition. Scrape along bottom of bowl to ensure batter is homogeneous.  
5. Pour batter into prepared pan and smooth top with rubber spatula. Bake cake until golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 1 hour 10 minutes to 1 hour 20 minutes. Let cake cool in pan on wire rack for 15 minutes, then invert cake onto wire rack and turn cake right side up. Let cake cool completely on rack, about 2 hours, before serving. (Cake can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 days.)  
ALMOND POUND CAKE  
Reduce vanilla extract to 1 teaspoon and add 1-1⁄2 teaspoons almond extract along with vanilla to eggs. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons sliced almonds over surface of batter just before baking.  
POUND CAKE WITH ORANGE ESSENCE  
Reduce vanilla extract to 1 teaspoon and add 1 tablespoon grated then minced orange zest to mixer bowl just after adding eggs in step 3.  
CLASSIC POUND CAKE IN A TUBE PAN  
Double all ingredients and substitute a 10-inch tube pan, greased and floured, for loaf pan. Bake cake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees and continue to bake until cake is golden brown and wooden skewer inserted in center of cake comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cake cool in pan on wire rack for 30 minutes, then invert cake onto wire rack and turn cake right side up. Let cake cool completely on rack, about 3 hours, before serving.

You can use a blender instead of a food processor to mix the batter. To add the butter, remove the center cap of the lid so the butter can be drizzled into the whirling blender with minimal splattering. This batter looks almost like a thick pancake batter and is very fluid. The test kitchen’s preferred loaf pan measures 8-1⁄2 by 4-1⁄2 inches; if you use a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan, start checking for doneness 5 minutes earlier than advised in the recipe.  
CAKE  
16 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1-1⁄2 cups (6 ounces) cake flour  
1 teaspoon baking powder  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
1-1⁄4 cups (8-3⁄4 ounces) sugar  
2 tablespoons grated lemon zest plus 2 teaspoons juice (2 lemons)  
4 large eggs, room temperature  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
LEMON GLAZE  
1⁄2 cup (3-1⁄2 ounces) sugar  
1⁄4 cup lemon juice (2 lemons)  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour 8-1⁄2 by 4-1⁄2-inch loaf pan. In medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt; set aside.  
2. Melt butter in small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk melted butter thoroughly to reincorporate any separated milk solids.  
3. Pulse sugar and lemon zest in food processor until combined, about 5 pulses. Add lemon juice, eggs, and vanilla and process until combined, about 5 seconds. With machine running, add melted butter in steady stream (this should take about 20 seconds). Transfer mixture to large bowl. Sift flour mixture over eggs in 3 steps, whisking gently after each addition until just combined.  
4. Pour batter into prepared pan and smooth top with rubber spatula. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees and continue baking until deep golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 35 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking. Let cake cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn onto wire rack. Poke cake’s top and sides with toothpick. Let cool to room temperature, at least 1 hour. (Cooled cake can be stored at room temperature for up to 5 days.)  
5. FOR THE GLAZE: While cake is cooling, bring sugar and lemon juice to boil in small saucepan, stirring occasionally to dissolve sugar. Reduce heat to low and simmer until thickened slightly, about 2 minutes. Brush top and sides of cake with glaze and let cool to room temperature before serving.

It is important to pour the glaze over cake after it has cooled for just 10 minutes and is still warm. Serve this cake as is or dress it up with lightly sweetened berries. The cake has a light, fluffy texture when eaten the day it is baked, but if well wrapped and held at room temperature overnight its texture becomes more dense—like that of pound cake—the following day.

3 tablespoons grated lemon zest plus 3 tablespoons juice (3 lemons)  
3 cups (15 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1 teaspoon baking powder  
1⁄2 teaspoon baking soda  
1 teaspoon salt  
3⁄4 cup buttermilk  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
3 large eggs plus 1 large yolk, room temperature  
18 tablespoons unsalted butter (2-1⁄4 sticks), softened  
2 cups (14 ounces) sugar

2–3 tablespoons lemon juice  
1 tablespoon buttermilk  
2 cups (8 ounces) confectioners’ sugar  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position; heat oven to 350 degrees. Spray 12-cup nonstick Bundt pan with baking spray with flour. Mince lemon zest to fine paste (you should have about 2 tablespoons). Combine zest and lemon juice in small bowl; set aside to soften, 10 to 15 minutes.  
2. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in large bowl. Combine lemon juice mixture, buttermilk, and vanilla in medium bowl. In small bowl, gently whisk eggs and egg yolk to combine. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter and sugar on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce speed to medium and add half of eggs, mixing until incorporated, about 15 seconds. Repeat with remaining eggs and scrape down bowl. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with 2 additions of buttermilk mixture, scraping down bowl as needed. Give batter final stir by hand.

4. FOR THE GLAZE: While cake is baking, whisk 2 tablespoons lemon juice, buttermilk, and confectioners’ sugar until smooth, adding more lemon juice gradually as needed until glaze is thick but still pourable (mixture should leave faint trail across bottom of mixing bowl when drizzled from whisk). Pour half of glaze over warm cake and let cool for 1 hour; pour remaining glaze evenly over top of cake and continue to cool to room temperature, at least 2 hours, before serving.

The melted chocolate should be cooled to between 85 and 100 degrees before being added to the frosting. If the frosting seems too soft after adding the chocolate, chill it briefly in the refrigerator and then rewhip it until creamy.  
1⁄3 cup (2-1⁄3 ounces) granulated sugar  
2 large egg whites  
Pinch salt  
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 12 pieces and softened  
6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, melted and cooled  
1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
#instructions  
1. Combine sugar, egg whites, and salt in bowl of stand mixer and set bowl over saucepan filled with 1 inch of barely simmering water. Whisking gently but constantly, heat mixture until slightly thickened, foamy, and registers 150 degrees, 2 to 3 minutes.  
2. Fit stand mixer with whisk and beat mixture on medium speed until consistency of shaving cream and slightly cooled, 1 to 2 minutes. Add butter, 1 piece at a time, until smooth and creamy. (Frosting may look curdled after half of butter has been added; it will smooth with additional butter.) Once all butter is added, add cooled melted chocolate and vanilla; mix until combined. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until light, fluffy, and thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds, scraping down beater and sides of bowl with rubber spatula as necessary.  
TO MAKE AHEAD: Frosting can be made up to 1 day in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container. When ready to frost, warm frosting briefly in microwave until just slightly softened, 5 to 10 seconds. Once warmed, stir until creamy.  
CREAMY MALTED MILK FROSTING  
Reduce sugar to 1⁄4 cup, substitute milk chocolate for bittersweet chocolate, and add 1⁄4 cup malted milk powder to frosting with vanilla extract in step 2.  
CREAMY VANILLA FROSTING  
Omit bittersweet chocolate and increase sugar to 1⁄2 cup. (If final frosting seems too thick, warm mixer bowl briefly over pan filled with 1 inch of simmering water and beat a second time until creamy).  
CREAMY PEANUT BUTTER FROSTING  
Omit bittersweet chocolate, increase sugar to 1⁄2 cup, and increase salt to 1⁄8 teaspoon. Add 2⁄3 cup creamy peanut butter to frosting with vanilla extract in step 2. Garnish cupcakes with 1⁄2 cup chopped peanuts.  
CREAMY BUTTERSCOTCH FROSTING  
Substitute dark brown sugar for granulated sugar and increase salt to 1⁄2 teaspoon.

LEMON PUDDING CAKE  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
This pudding cake can be made in any of the following: six 3⁄4-cup custard cups, four 1-1⁄3-cup ramekins or miniature soufflé cups, one 9-inch round cake pan, or one 8-inch square cake pan. All pudding cakes, regardless of pan size, require the same baking time.  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened  
1⁄2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (4-1⁄3 ounces) sugar  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
3 large eggs, separated, plus 1 large white, room temperature  
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons grated lemon zest plus 1⁄4 cup juice (2 lemons)  
1 cup whole milk  
Pinch cream of tartar  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Grease pan or baking molds of choice. Lay folded kitchen towel in bottom of roasting pan and set molds or pan inside. Bring kettle of water to boil.  
2. Meanwhile, using back of wooden spoon, mash butter, sugar, and salt together in medium bowl until crumbly. Beat in egg yolks, then stir in flour, mixing until smooth. Slowly beat in lemon zest and juice, then stir in milk. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip egg whites and cream of tartar on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and whip until stiff peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Gently whisk whites into batter by hand just until no large lumps remain.  
3. Immediately ladle (do not pour) batter into pan or baking molds of choice. Set roasting pan on oven rack. Quickly pour enough boiling water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of pan or molds. Bake cake until center is set and springs back when gently touched, about 25 minutes. Remove roasting pan from oven and let pan or molds continue to sit in water bath for 10 minutes. Serve warm, at room temperature, or chilled.  
ORANGE PUDDING CAKE  
Reduce lemon juice to 2 tablespoons and add 1⁄4 cup orange juice with lemon juice in step 2. Substitute 1-1⁄2 teaspoons orange zest for lemon zest.  
COFFEE PUDDING CAKE  
This cake tastes best when made with very strong coffee. The easiest way to make it strong is to cover 1⁄3 cup finely ground coffee with 2⁄3 cup boiling water and let it stand for 5 minutes, then drip through a coffee filter.  
Substitute 1⁄3 cup room-temperature brewed strong coffee and 2 tablespoons coffee-flavored liqueur for lemon juice and zest. Decrease sugar to 1⁄2 cup and flour to 2 tablespoons.  
CHOCOLATE PUDDING CAKE  
Slowly stir 1⁄2 cup boiling water into 1⁄3 cup cocoa. Cool paste slightly, then stir in 1 tablespoon dark rum. Substitute cocoa paste for lemon zest and juice. Decrease flour to 2 tablespoons.

3⁄4 cup warm water  
1⁄2 teaspoon baking soda  
1-1⁄4 cups (6-1⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄2 teaspoon baking powder  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
3⁄4 cup packed (5-1⁄4 ounces) brown sugar  
2 large eggs  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
SAUCE  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1 cup packed (7 ounces) brown sugar  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1 cup heavy cream  
1 tablespoon rum  
1⁄2 teaspoon lemon juice  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CAKES: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour eight 4-ounce ramekins. Set prepared ramekins in large roasting pan lined with clean kitchen towel. Bring kettle of water to boil.  
2. Combine half of dates, water, and baking soda in 2-cup liquid measuring cup (dates should be submerged beneath water) and soak dates for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in medium bowl.  
3. Process remaining dates and brown sugar in food processor until no large date chunks remain and mixture has texture of damp, coarse sand, about 45 seconds, scraping down bowl as needed. Drain soaked dates and add soaking liquid to processor. Add eggs, melted butter, and vanilla and process until smooth, about 15 seconds. Transfer mixture to bowl with dry ingredients and sprinkle drained soaked dates on top.  
4. With rubber spatula or wooden spoon, gently fold wet mixture into dry mixture until just combined and date pieces are evenly dispersed. Divide batter evenly among prepared ramekins (should be two-thirds full). Quickly pour enough boiling water into roasting pan to come 1⁄4 inch up sides of molds. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil, crimping edges to seal. Bake cakes until puffed and surfaces are spongy, firm, and moist to touch, about 40 minutes. Immediately transfer ramekins from water bath to wire rack and let cool for 10 minutes.  
5. FOR THE SAUCE: While cakes cool, melt butter in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk in sugar and salt until smooth. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved and slightly darkened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add 1⁄3 cup cream and stir until smooth, about 30 seconds. Slowly pour in remaining 2⁄3 cup cream and rum, whisking constantly until smooth. Reduce heat to low and simmer until frothy, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice.  
6. Using toothpick, poke 25 holes in top of each cake and spoon 1 tablespoon toffee sauce over each cake. Let cakes sit until sauce is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Invert each ramekin onto plate or shallow bowl and remove ramekin. Divide remaining toffee sauce evenly among cakes and serve immediately.  
TO MAKE AHEAD: Prepare batter and divide among individual ramekins as directed, then cover and refrigerate, unbaked, for up to 1 day. Bake as directed in step 4. Sauce can be made up to 2 days in advance; microwave on 50 percent power, stirring often, until hot, about 3 minutes.

TRIPLE-CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE  
#quantity  
SERVES 12 TO 16  
#ingredients  
This recipe requires a springform pan with sides that are at least 3 inches high. It is imperative that each layer is made in sequential order. Cool the base completely before topping it with the middle layer. For best results, chill the mixer bowl before whipping the heavy cream. For neater slices, use a cheese wire or dip your knife in hot water before cutting each slice.  
BOTTOM LAYER  
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 6 pieces  
7 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped fine  
3⁄4 teaspoon instant espresso powder  
4 large eggs, separated  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
Pinch cream of tartar  
Pinch salt  
1⁄3 cup packed (2-1⁄3 ounces) light brown sugar  
MIDDLE LAYER  
5 tablespoons hot water  
2 tablespoons Dutch-processed cocoa  
7 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped fine  
1-1⁄2 cups heavy cream, chilled  
1 tablespoon granulated sugar  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
TOP LAYER  
3⁄4 teaspoon unflavored gelatin  
1 tablespoon water  
6 ounces white chocolate chips  
1-1⁄2 cups heavy cream, chilled  
Shaved chocolate (optional)  
Cocoa (optional)  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE BOTTOM LAYER: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Grease 9-1⁄2-inch springform pan. Melt butter, chocolate, and espresso in large heatproof bowl set over saucepan filled with 1 inch of barely simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat and let mixture cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Whisk in egg yolks and vanilla; set aside.  
2. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Add half of sugar and whip until combined, about 15 seconds. Add remaining sugar, increase speed to high, and whip until soft peaks form, about 1 minute longer, scraping down bowl halfway through. Using whisk, fold one-third of beaten egg whites into chocolate mixture by hand to lighten. Using rubber spatula, fold in remaining egg whites until no white streaks remain. Carefully transfer batter to prepared springform pan and smooth top with rubber spatula.  
3. Bake cake until risen, firm around edges, and center has just set but is still soft (center of cake will spring back after pressing gently with finger), 13 to 18 minutes. Transfer cake to wire rack and let cool completely, about 1 hour. (Cake will collapse as it cools.) Do not remove cake from pan.  
4. FOR THE MIDDLE LAYER: Combine hot water and cocoa in small bowl; set aside. Melt chocolate in large heatproof bowl set over saucepan filled with 1 inch of barely simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat and let cool slightly, 2 to 5 minutes.  
5. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip cream, sugar, and salt on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until soft peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes.  
6. Whisk cocoa mixture into melted chocolate until smooth. Using whisk, fold one-third of whipped cream into chocolate mixture to lighten. Using rubber spatula, fold in remaining whipped cream until no white streaks remain. Spoon mousse into springform pan over cooled cake, smooth top with rubber spatula, and gently tap pan on counter to release air bubbles. Wipe inside edge of pan with damp cloth to remove any drips. Refrigerate cake for at least 15 minutes while preparing top layer.  
7. FOR THE TOP LAYER: In small bowl, sprinkle gelatin over water and let sit for at least 5 minutes. Place white chocolate in medium heatproof bowl. Bring 1⁄2 cup cream to simmer in small saucepan over medium-high heat. Remove from heat, add gelatin mixture, and stir until fully dissolved. Pour cream mixture over white chocolate and let sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Whisk mixture gently until smooth. Let cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally (mixture will thicken slightly).  
8. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip remaining 1 cup cream on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until soft peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. Using whisk, fold one-third of whipped cream into white chocolate mixture to lighten. Using rubber spatula, fold remaining whipped cream into white chocolate mixture until no white streaks remain. Spoon white chocolate mousse into pan over middle layer. Smooth top with rubber spatula. Return cake to refrigerator and chill until set, at least 2-1⁄2 hours. (Cake can be refrigerated for up to 1 day; leave at room temperature for up to 45 minutes before removing from pan.)  
9. TO SERVE: Garnish top of cake with shaved chocolate and/or dust with cocoa, if using. Run thin knife between cake and sides of pan; remove sides of pan. Run cleaned knife along outside of cake to smooth. Hold handles of cheese wire and pull wire taut. Using thumbs to apply even pressure, slice down through the cake. Wipe wire clean with dry towel. Make second cut, perpendicular to first. Continue to make cuts around circumference. Serve.  
SLICING A SOFT CAKE  
To create perfectly smooth slices of soft desserts such as Triple-Chocolate Mousse Cake, the best tool is not a knife. It’s a cheese wire—the minimal surface area produces less drag for cleaner, neater slices. If you don’t have a cheese wire, dental floss will work almost as well.  
#instructions  
1. Hold handles of wire and pull wire taut. Using thumbs to apply even pressure, slice down through cake. Wipe wire clean with paper towel.  
2. Make second cut, perpendicular to first. Continue to make cuts around circumference.

TIRAMISÙ  
#quantity  
SERVES 10 TO 12  
#ingredients  
Brandy and even whiskey can stand in for the dark rum. The test kitchen prefers a tiramisù with a pronounced rum flavor; for a less potent rum flavor, reduce the rum added to the coffee mixture in step 1 to 2-1⁄2 tablespoons. Do not allow the mascarpone to warm to room temperature before using it; it has a tendency to break if allowed to do so. Be certain to use hard, not soft, ladyfingers.  
2-1⁄2 cups strong brewed coffee, room temperature  
9 tablespoons dark rum  
1-1⁄2 tablespoons instant espresso powder  
6 large egg yolks  
2⁄3 cup sugar  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1-1⁄2 pounds mascarpone cheese (3 cups)  
3⁄4 cup heavy cream, chilled  
14 ounces ladyfingers (42 to 60, depending on size)  
3-1⁄2 tablespoons Dutch-processed cocoa  
1⁄4 cup semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, grated (optional)  
#instructions  
1. Stir coffee, 5 tablespoons rum, and espresso in wide bowl or baking dish until espresso dissolves; set aside.  
2. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip egg yolks on low speed until just combined. Add sugar and salt and whip on medium-high speed until pale yellow, 1-1⁄2 to 2 minutes, scraping down bowl once or twice. Add remaining 4 tablespoons rum and whip on medium speed until just combined, 20 to 30 seconds; scrape down bowl. Add mascarpone and whip on medium speed until no lumps remain, 30 to 45 seconds, scraping down bowl once or twice. Transfer mixture to large bowl and set aside.  
3. In now-empty mixer bowl, whip cream on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until stiff peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. Using rubber spatula, fold one-third of whipped cream into mascarpone mixture to lighten, then gently fold in remaining whipped cream until no white streaks remain. Set mascarpone mixture aside.  
4. Working with one at a time, drop half of ladyfingers into coffee mixture, roll to coat, remove, and transfer to 13 by 9-inch glass or ceramic baking dish. (Do not submerge ladyfingers in coffee mixture; entire process should take no longer than 2 to 3 seconds for each cookie.) Arrange soaked cookies in single layer in baking dish, breaking or trimming ladyfingers as needed to fit neatly into dish.  
5. Spread half of mascarpone mixture over ladyfingers with spatula, spreading mixture to sides and into corners of dish, then smooth surface. Place 2 tablespoons cocoa in fine-mesh strainer and dust cocoa over mascarpone.  
6. Repeat dipping and arrangement of ladyfingers; spread remaining mascarpone mixture over ladyfingers and dust with remaining 1-1⁄2 tablespoons cocoa. Wipe edges of dish clean with paper towel. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or up to 24 hours. Garnish with grated chocolate, if using; cut into pieces and serve chilled. (Tiramisù can be refrigerated for up to 1 day.)  
TIRAMISÙ WITH FRANGELICO AND ORANGE  
Amaretto can be substituted for the Frangelico, and brandy and even whiskey can stand in for the dark rum.  
Reduce dark rum to 5 tablespoons total, adding 3 tablespoons rum, plus 3 tablespoons Frangelico, to coffee mixture in step 1, and 2 tablespoons rum plus 3 tablespoons Frangelico to whipped egg yolk mixture in step 2. Whip 1⁄2 teaspoon grated orange zest with mascarpone in step 2.  
TIRAMISÙ WITH SAMBUCA AND LEMON  
Omit dark rum. Stir in 2 tablespoons Sambuca with coffee and espresso in step 1. Add 2 tablespoons sambuca to whipped egg yolk mixture in step 2. Whip 1-1⁄4 teaspoons minced grated lemon zest with mascarpone in step 2.  
TIRAMISÙ WITHOUT RAW EGGS  
This recipe involves cooking the yolks in a double boiler, which requires a little more effort and makes for a slightly thicker mascarpone filling, but the results are just as good as with our traditional method. You will need an additional 1⁄3 cup heavy cream.  
In step 2, add 1⁄3 cup cream to egg yolks after sugar and salt; do not whisk in rum. Set bowl with egg yolks over medium saucepan filled with 1 inch of barely simmering water and cook, constantly scraping along bottom and sides of bowl with heatproof rubber spatula, until mixture coats back of spoon and registers 160 degrees, 4 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and stir vigorously to cool slightly, then set aside and let cool completely, about 15 minutes. Whisk in remaining 4 tablespoons rum until combined. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip egg yolk mixture and mascarpone together on medium speed until no lumps remain, 30 to 45 seconds. Transfer mixture to large bowl and set aside. Continue with recipe from step 3, using full amount of cream specified (3⁄4 cup).

NEW YORK–STYLE CHEESECAKE  
#quantity  
SERVES 12 TO 16  
#ingredients  
For the crust, chocolate wafers can be substituted for graham crackers; you will need about 14 wafers. The flavor and texture of the cheesecake is best if the cake is allowed to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving. When cutting the cake, have a pitcher of hot tap water nearby; dipping the blade of the knife into the water and wiping it clean with a kitchen towel after each cut helps make neat slices. Serve with FRESH STRAWBERRY TOPPING if desired.  
CRUST  
8 whole graham crackers, broken into rough pieces  
1 tablespoon sugar  
5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
FILLING  
2-1⁄2 pounds cream cheese, cut into 1-inch chunks and softened  
1-1⁄2 cups (10-1⁄2 ounces) sugar  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
1⁄3 cup sour cream  
2 teaspoons lemon juice  
2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
6 large eggs plus 2 large yolks  
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CRUST: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Process graham cracker pieces in food processor to fine crumbs, about 30 seconds. Combine graham cracker crumbs and sugar in medium bowl, add melted butter, and toss with fork until evenly moistened. Empty crumbs into 9-inch springform pan and, using bottom of ramekin or dry measuring cup, press crumbs firmly and evenly into pan bottom, keeping sides as clean as possible. Bake crust until fragrant and beginning to brown around edges, about 13 minutes. Let crust cool in pan on wire rack while making filling.  
2. FOR THE FILLING: Increase oven temperature to 500 degrees. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat cream cheese on medium-low speed until broken up and slightly softened, about 1 minute. Scrape down bowl. Add 3⁄4 cup sugar and salt and beat on medium-low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down bowl, then beat in remaining 3⁄4 cup sugar until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down bowl, add sour cream, lemon juice, and vanilla, and beat on low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down bowl, add egg yolks, and beat on medium-low speed until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down bowl, add whole eggs, 2 at a time, beating until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute, and scraping bowl between additions.  
3. Being careful not to disturb baked crust, brush inside of pan with melted butter and set pan on rimmed baking sheet to catch any spills in case pan leaks. Pour filling into cooled crust and bake 10 minutes; without opening oven door, reduce temperature to 200 degrees and continue to bake until cheesecake registers about 150 degrees, about 1-1⁄2 hours. Let cake cool on wire rack for 5 minutes, then run paring knife around cake to loosen from pan. Let cake continue to cool until barely warm, 2-1⁄2 to 3 hours. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, at least 3 hours. (Cake can be refrigerated for up to 4 days.)  
4. To unmold cheesecake, wrap hot kitchen towel around pan and let stand for 1 minute. Remove sides of pan. Slide thin metal spatula between crust and pan bottom to loosen, then slide cake onto serving platter. Let cheesecake sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes before serving. (Cheesecake can be made up to 3 days in advance; however, crust will begin to lose its crispness after only 1 day.)

Add sugar and pulse 2 or 3 times to incorporate. Add melted butter in slow, steady stream while pulsing; pulse until mixture is evenly moistened and resembles wet sand, about 10 pulses. Empty crumbs into 9-inch springform pan and, using bottom of ramekin or dry measuring cup, press crumbs firmly and evenly into pan bottom, keeping sides as clean as possible. Bake crust until fragrant and golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Let cool on wire rack to room temperature, about 30 minutes. When cool, wrap outside of pan with two 18-inch square pieces heavy-duty aluminum foil and set springform pan in roasting pan. Bring kettle of water to boil.  
2. FOR THE FILLING: While crust is cooling, process 1⁄4 cup sugar and lemon zest in food processor until sugar is yellow and zest is broken down, about 15 seconds, scraping down bowl as needed. Transfer lemon-sugar mixture to small bowl and stir in remaining 1 cup sugar.  
3. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat cream cheese on low speed until broken up and slightly softened, about 5 seconds. With mixer running, add lemon-sugar mixture in slow, steady stream; increase speed to medium and continue to beat until mixture is creamy and smooth, about 3 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. Reduce speed to medium-low and beat in eggs, 2 at a time, until incorporated, about 30 seconds, scraping down bowl well after each addition. Add lemon juice, vanilla, and salt and mix until just incorporated, about 5 seconds. Add heavy cream and mix until just incorporated, about 5 seconds longer. Give filling final stir by hand.  
4. Being careful not to disturb baked crust, brush inside of pan with melted butter. Pour filling into prepared pan and smooth top with rubber spatula. Set roasting pan on oven rack and pour enough boiling water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of pan. Bake cake until center jiggles slightly, sides just start to puff, surface is no longer shiny, and cake registers 150 degrees, 55 minutes to 1 hour. Turn off oven and prop open oven door with potholder or wooden spoon handle; allow cake to cool in water bath in oven for 1 hour. Transfer pan to wire rack. Remove foil, then run paring knife around cake and let cake cool completely on wire rack, about 2 hours.  
5. FOR THE LEMON CURD: While cheesecake bakes, heat lemon juice in small saucepan over medium heat until hot but not boiling. Whisk eggs and egg yolk together in medium bowl, then gradually whisk in sugar. Whisking constantly, slowly pour hot lemon juice into eggs, then return mixture to saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with wooden spoon, until mixture is thick enough to cling to spoon and registers 170 degrees, about 3 minutes. Immediately remove pan from heat and stir in cold butter until incorporated. Stir in cream, vanilla, and salt, then pour curd through fine-mesh strainer into small bowl. Place plastic wrap directly on surface of curd and refrigerate until needed.  
6. When cheesecake is cool, scrape lemon curd onto cheesecake still in springform pan. Using offset spatula, spread curd evenly over top of cheesecake. Cover tightly with plastic and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 1 day. To unmold cheesecake, wrap hot kitchen towel around pan and let stand for 1 minute. Remove sides of pan. Slide thin metal spatula between crust and pan bottom to loosen, then slide cake onto serving platter and serve. (Cake can be made up to 3 days in advance; however, the crust will begin to lose its crispness after only 1 day.)  
GOAT CHEESE AND LEMON CHEESECAKE WITH HAZELNUT CRUST  
The goat cheese gives this cheesecake a distinctive tang and a slightly savory edge. Use a mild-flavored goat cheese.  
For crust, process generous 1⁄3 cup hazelnuts, toasted, skinned, and cooled, in food processor with sugar until finely ground and mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, about 30 seconds. Add cookies and process until mixture is finely and evenly ground, about 30 seconds. Reduce melted butter to 3 tablespoons. For filling, reduce cream cheese to 1 pound and beat 8 ounces room-temperature goat cheese with cream cheese in step 3. Omit salt.  
TRIPLE CITRUS CHEESECAKE  
For filling, reduce lemon zest to 1 teaspoon and lemon juice to 1 tablespoon. Process 1 teaspoon grated lime zest and 1 teaspoon grated orange zest with lemon zest in step 2. Add 1 tablespoon lime juice and 2 tablespoons orange juice to mixer with lemon juice in step 3. For curd, reduce lemon juice to 2 tablespoons and heat 2 tablespoons lime juice, 4 teaspoons orange juice, and 2 teaspoons grated orange zest with lemon juice in step 5. Omit vanilla.

SPICED PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE  
#quantity  
SERVES 12 TO 16  
#ingredients  
Make sure to buy unsweetened canned pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling, which is preseasoned and sweetened. This cheesecake is good on its own, but the BROWN SUGAR WHIPPED CREAM is a great addition. When cutting the cake, have a pitcher of hot tap water nearby; dipping the blade of the knife into the water and wiping it clean with a kitchen towel after each cut helps make neat slices.  
CRUST  
9 whole graham crackers, broken into rough pieces  
3 tablespoons sugar  
1⁄2 teaspoon ground ginger  
1⁄2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
1⁄4 teaspoon ground cloves  
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
FILLING  
1-1⁄3 cups (10-1⁄3 ounces) sugar  
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
1⁄2 teaspoon ground ginger  
1⁄4 teaspoon ground nutmeg  
1⁄4 teaspoon ground cloves  
1⁄4 teaspoon allspice  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin  
1-1⁄2 pounds cream cheese, cut into 1-inch chunks and softened  
1 tablespoon vanilla extract  
1 tablespoon lemon juice  
5 large eggs, room temperature  
1 cup heavy cream  
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CRUST: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Pulse crackers, sugar, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves in food processor until crackers are finely ground, about 15 pulses. Transfer crumbs to medium bowl, drizzle with melted butter, and mix with rubber spatula until evenly moistened. Empty crumbs into 9-inch springform pan and, using bottom of ramekin or dry measuring cup, press crumbs firmly and evenly into pan bottom, keeping sides as clean as possible. Bake crust until fragrant and browned around edges, about 15 minutes. Let crust cool completely on wire rack, about 30 minutes. When cool, wrap outside of pan with two 18-inch square pieces heavy-duty aluminum foil and set springform pan in roasting pan. Bring kettle of water to boil.  
2. FOR THE FILLING: Whisk sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, allspice, and salt in small bowl; set aside. Line baking sheet with triple layer of paper towels. Spread pumpkin on paper towels in roughly even layer and pat puree with several layers of paper towels to wick away moisture.  
3. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat cream cheese on medium speed until broken up and slightly softened, about 1 minute. Scrape down bowl, then beat in sugar mixture in 3 additions on medium-low speed until combined, about 1 minute, scraping down bowl after each addition. Add pumpkin, vanilla, and lemon juice and beat on medium speed until combined, about 45 seconds; scrape down bowl. Reduce speed to medium-low, add eggs, 1 at a time, and beat until incorporated, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to low, add heavy cream, and beat until combined, about 45 seconds. Give filling final stir by hand.  
4. Being careful not to disturb baked crust, brush inside of pan with melted butter. Pour filling into prepared pan and smooth top with rubber spatula. Set roasting pan on oven rack and pour enough boiling water into roasting pan to come about halfway up sides of springform pan. Bake cake until center is slightly wobbly when pan is shaken and cake registers 150 degrees, about 1-1⁄2 hours. Set roasting pan on wire rack then run paring knife around cake. Let cake cool in roasting pan until water is just warm, about 45 minutes. Remove springform pan from water bath, discard foil, and set on wire rack; continue to let cool until barely warm, about 3 hours. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours.  
5. To unmold cheesecake, wrap hot kitchen towel around pan and let stand for 1 minute. Remove sides of pan. Slide thin metal spatula between crust and pan bottom to loosen, then slide cake onto serving platter. Let cheesecake sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes before serving. (Cake can be made up to 3 days in advance; however, the crust will begin to lose its crispness after only 1 day.)  
PUMPKIN-BOURBON CHEESECAKE WITH GRAHAM-PECAN CRUST  
Reducing graham crackers to 5 whole crackers, process 1⁄2 cup chopped pecans with crackers and reduce butter to 4 tablespoons. In filling, omit lemon juice, reduce vanilla extract to 1 teaspoon, and add 1⁄4 cup bourbon along with heavy cream.

FOOLPROOF DOUBLE-CRUST PIE DOUGH  
#quantity  
MAKES ENOUGH FOR ONE 9-INCH PIE  
#ingredients  
Vodka is essential to the tender texture of this crust and imparts no flavor—do not substitute water. This dough is moister than most standard pie doughs and will require lots of flour to roll out (up to 1⁄4 cup). A food processor is essential to making this dough—it cannot be made by hand.  
2-1⁄2 cups (12-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
2 tablespoons sugar  
1 teaspoon salt  
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄4-inch pieces and chilled  
8 tablespoons vegetable shortening, cut into 4 pieces and chilled  
1⁄4 cup vodka, chilled  
1⁄4 cup ice water  
#instructions  
1. Process 1-1⁄2 cups flour, sugar, and salt together in food processor until combined, about 5 seconds. Scatter butter and shortening over top and continue to process until incorporated and mixture begins to form uneven clumps with no remaining floury bits, about 15 seconds.  
2. Scrape down bowl and redistribute dough evenly around processor blade. Sprinkle remaining 1 cup flour over dough and pulse until mixture has broken up into pieces and is evenly distributed around bowl, 4 to 6 pulses.  
3. Transfer mixture to large bowl. Sprinkle vodka and ice water over mixture. Stir and press dough together, using stiff rubber spatula, until dough sticks together.  
4. Divide dough into 2 even pieces. Turn each piece of dough onto sheet of plastic wrap and flatten each into 4-inch disk. Wrap each piece tightly in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour. Before rolling dough out, let it sit on counter to soften slightly, about 10 minutes. (Dough can be wrapped tightly in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 1 month. If frozen, let dough thaw completely on counter before rolling it out.)

1 recipe CLASSIC DOUBLE-CRUST PIE DOUGH  
1 large egg white, lightly beaten  
#instructions  
1. Bring cranberries, orange juice, 1⁄2 cup sugar, 1⁄4 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1⁄4 teaspoon salt to boil in medium saucepan. Cook, stirring occasionally and pressing berries against side of pot, until berries have completely broken down and juices have thickened to jamlike consistency (wooden spoon scraped across bottom should leave clear trail that doesn’t fill in), 10 to 12 minutes. Off heat, stir in water and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. (Cooled filling can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.)  
2. Meanwhile, mix 1⁄2 cup sugar, remaining 1⁄4 teaspoon cinnamon, remaining 1⁄4 teaspoon salt, and cornstarch together in large bowl. Add apples and toss to combine. Cover and microwave, stirring with rubber spatula every 3 minutes, until apples are just starting to turn translucent around edges and liquid is thick and glossy, 10 to 14 minutes. Let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. (Cooled filling can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.)  
3. While fillings cool, adjust oven rack to lowest position, place rimmed baking sheet on rack, and heat oven to 425 degrees. Roll 1 disk of dough into 12-inch circle on lightly floured counter. Loosely roll dough around rolling pin and gently unroll it onto 9-inch pie plate, letting excess dough hang over edge. Ease dough into plate by gently lifting edge of dough with one hand while pressing into plate bottom with other hand. Leave any dough that overhangs plate in place. Wrap dough-lined pie plate loosely in plastic wrap and refrigerate until dough is firm, about 30 minutes. Roll other disk of dough into 12-inch circle on lightly floured counter, then transfer to parchment paper–lined baking sheet; cover with plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes.  
4. Spread cooled cranberry mixture into even layer in dough-lined pie plate. Place apple mixture on top of cranberries, mounding it slightly in center. Loosely roll remaining dough round around rolling pin and gently unroll it onto filling. Trim overhang to 1⁄2 inch beyond lip of pie plate. Pinch edges of top and bottom crusts firmly together. Tuck overhang under itself; folded edge should be flush with edge of pie plate. Crimp dough evenly around edge of pie using your fingers. Cut four 2-inch slits in top of dough. Brush surface with beaten egg white and sprinkle evenly with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.  
5. Place pie on heated baking sheet and bake until crust is light golden brown, about 25 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees, rotate baking sheet, and continue to bake until juices are bubbling and crust is deep golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes longer. Let pie cool on wire rack until filling has set, about 2 hours; serve slightly warm or at room temperature.

FRESH LATTICE-TOP PEACH PIE  
#quantity  
SERVES 8  
#ingredients  
You can use FOOLPROOF, ALL-BUTTER, or CLASSIC DOUBLE-CRUST PIE DOUGH for this pie. If your peaches are firm, you should be able to peel them with a sharp vegetable peeler. If they are too soft to withstand the pressure of a peeler, you’ll need to blanch them in a pot of simmering water for 15 seconds and then shock them in a bowl of ice water before peeling. For more information on fitting pie dough, see “FITTING PIE DOUGH”.  
1 recipe CLASSIC DOUBLE-CRUST PIE DOUGH  
2-1⁄2 pounds peaches, peeled, halved, pitted, and sliced 1⁄3 inch thick  
1 cup (7 ounces) plus 1 tablespoon sugar  
1 tablespoon cornstarch  
1 tablespoon lemon juice  
Pinch ground cinnamon  
Pinch ground nutmeg  
Pinch salt  
1 large egg white, lightly beaten  
#instructions  
1. Roll 1 disk of dough into 12-inch circle on lightly floured counter. Loosely roll dough around rolling pin and gently unroll it onto 9-inch pie plate, letting excess dough hang over edge. Ease dough into plate by gently lifting edge of dough with 1 hand while pressing into plate bottom with other hand. Leave any dough that overhangs plate in place. Wrap dough-lined pie plate loosely in plastic wrap and refrigerate until dough is firm, about 30 minutes.  
2. Roll other disk of dough into 13-1⁄2 by 10-1⁄2-inch rectangle on lightly floured counter, then transfer to parchment paper–lined baking sheet. Trim dough to 13 by 10-inch rectangle and slice lengthwise into eight 13-inch-long strips. Separate strips slightly, cover with plastic, and freeze until very firm, about 30 minutes.  
3. Toss peaches and 1 cup sugar together in large bowl and let sit, tossing occasionally, until peaches release their juice, about 1 hour. Adjust oven rack to lowest position, place rimmed baking sheet on rack, and heat oven to 425 degrees.  
4. Drain peaches thoroughly in colander, reserving 1⁄4 cup of juice. In large bowl, toss drained fruit, reserved juice, cornstarch, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt together until well combined.  
5. Spread peaches into dough-lined pie plate. Lay 4 parallel strips of chilled dough evenly over filling. Weave remaining strips in opposite direction, one at a time, to create lattice (if dough becomes too soft to work with, refrigerate pie and dough strips until dough firms up). Let strips soften for 5 to 10 minutes, then trim overhang to 1⁄2 inch beyond lip of pie plate. Pinch edges of crust and lattice strips together, then tuck overhang under itself; folded edge should be flush with edge of pie plate. Crimp dough evenly around edge of pie using fingers. Brush lattice with beaten egg white and sprinkle evenly with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.  
6. Place pie on heated baking sheet and bake until top crust is light golden brown, about 25 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees, rotate baking sheet, and continue to bake until juices are bubbling and crust is deep golden brown, 25 to 35 minutes longer. Let pie cool on wire rack until filling has set, about 2 hours; serve slightly warm or at room temperature.  
WEAVING A LATTICE TOP  
#instructions  
1. Lay 4 parallel strips evenly over filling. Weave fifth strip in opposite direction, lifting strips as needed to make weaving easier.  
2. Continue to weave in remaining 3 strips, one at a time, to create lattice.  
3. After letting strips soften, trim overhanging edges of dough to 1⁄2 inch beyond lip of pie plate. Press edges of bottom crust and lattice strips together and tuck underneath.  
4. Create fluted edge around pie, using index finger of 1 hand and thumb and index finger of other.

FRESH STRAWBERRY PIE  
#quantity  
SERVES 8  
#ingredients  
You can use FOOLPROOF, ALL-BUTTER, or CLASSIC SINGLE-CRUST PIE DOUGH for this pie. To account for any imperfect strawberries, the ingredient list calls for several more ounces of berries than will be used in the pie. If possible, seek out ripe, farmers’ market–quality berries. Make sure to thoroughly dry the strawberries after washing. Make certain that you use Sure-Jell engineered for low- or no-sugar recipes (packaged in a pink box) and not regular Sure-Jell (in a yellow box); otherwise, the glaze will not set properly. The pie is at its best after two or three hours of chilling; as it continues to chill, the glaze becomes softer and wetter, though the pie will taste just as good.  
3 pounds strawberries, hulled (9 cups)  
3⁄4 cup (5-1⁄4 ounces) sugar  
2 tablespoons cornstarch  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons Sure-Jell for low-sugar recipes  
Pinch salt  
1 tablespoon lemon juice  
1 recipe CLASSIC SINGLE-CRUST PIE DOUGH dough, fully baked and cooled  
#instructions  
1. Select 6 ounces misshapen, underripe, or otherwise unattractive berries, halving those that are large; you should have about 1-1⁄2 cups. Process berries in food processor to smooth puree, 20 to 30 seconds, scraping down bowl as needed (you should have about 3⁄4 cup puree).  
2. Whisk sugar, cornstarch, Sure-Jell, and salt together in medium saucepan. Stir in berry puree, making sure to scrape corners of pan. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, and bring to boil. Boil, scraping bottom and sides of pan to prevent scorching, for 2 minutes to ensure that cornstarch is fully cooked (mixture will appear frothy when it first reaches boil, then will darken and thicken with further cooking). Transfer glaze to large bowl and stir in lemon juice; let cool to room temperature.  
3. Meanwhile, pick over remaining berries and measure out 2 pounds of most attractive ones; halve only extra-large berries. Add berries to bowl with glaze and fold gently with rubber spatula until berries are evenly coated. Scoop berries into cooled prebaked pie shell, piling into mound. If any cut sides face up on top, turn them face down. If necessary, rearrange berries so that holes are filled and mound looks attractive. Refrigerate pie until filling is chilled and has set, about 2 hours. Serve within 5 hours of chilling.

SWEET POTATO PIE  
#quantity  
SERVES 8  
#ingredients  
You can use FOOLPROOF, ALL-BUTTER, or CLASSIC SINGLE-CRUST PIE DOUGH for this pie. Some tasters preferred a stronger bourbon flavor in the filling, so we give a range. If you like molasses, use the optional tablespoon; a few tasters felt it deepened the sweet potato flavor. The crust and filling must both be warm when the filling is added. The pie finishes cooking with residual heat; to ensure that the filling sets, let it cool at room temperature and not in the refrigerator. Serve with WHIPPED CREAM.  
2 pounds sweet potatoes  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened  
1 cup (7 ounces) granulated sugar  
3 large eggs plus 2 large yolks  
1⁄2 teaspoon ground nutmeg  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
2–3 tablespoons bourbon  
1 tablespoon molasses (optional)  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 recipe CLASSIC SINGLE-CRUST PIE DOUGH , partially baked and still warm  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Poke each potato several times with paring knife over entire surface. Place potatoes on paper towel–lined plate and microwave until tender but not mushy, about 10 minutes, flipping potatoes halfway through cooking. Hold potato with potholder or kitchen towel and peel with paring knife; transfer to large bowl and discard skin. Repeat with remaining potatoes (you should have about 2 cups). While potatoes are still hot, add butter and mash with potato masher until just few small potato lumps remain.  
2. Whisk granulated sugar, eggs, egg yolks, nutmeg, and salt together in medium bowl; stir in bourbon, molasses, if using, and vanilla, then whisk in milk. Gradually add egg mixture to mashed sweet potato mixture, whisking gently to combine.  
3. Sprinkle bottom of warm prebaked pie crust evenly with brown sugar, then pour sweet potato mixture on top. Bake pie until edges are set but center jiggles slightly when shaken, about 45 minutes. Let pie cool pie on wire rack to room temperature, about 4 hours. Serve.

SERVES 8  
#ingredients  
You can use FOOLPROOF, ALL-BUTTER, or CLASSIC SINGLE-CRUST PIE DOUGH for this pie. The crust must still be warm when the filling is added. To serve the pie warm, let it cool thoroughly so that it sets completely, then warm it in a 250-degree oven for about 15 minutes and slice. Serve with vanilla ice cream or WHIPPED CREAM.  
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces  
1 cup packed (7 ounces) dark brown sugar  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
3 large eggs  
3⁄4 cup light corn syrup  
1 tablespoon vanilla extract  
2 cups (8 ounces) pecans, toasted and chopped fine  
1 recipe CLASSIC SINGLE-CRUST PIE DOUGH , partially baked and still warm  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 275 degrees. Melt butter in heatproof bowl set in skillet of water maintained at just below simmer. Remove bowl from skillet and stir in sugar and salt until butter is absorbed. Whisk in eggs, then corn syrup and vanilla until smooth. Return bowl to hot water and stir until mixture is shiny, hot to touch, and registers 130 degrees. Off heat, stir in pecans.  
2. Pour pecan mixture into warm prebaked pie crust. Bake pie until filling looks set but yields like Jell-O when gently pressed with back of spoon, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let pie cool on wire rack until filling has set, about 2 hours; serve slightly warm or at room temperature.  
BUTTERMILK PECAN PIE WITH RAISINS  
To make a buttermilk chess pie, omit the nuts and raisins.  
Substitute 1-1⁄2 cups (10-1⁄2 ounces) granulated sugar for brown sugar and 2⁄3 cup buttermilk for corn syrup and vanilla. Reduce pecans to 1⁄2 cup and stir into pie filling along with 1⁄2 cup raisins, chopped fine.  
MAPLE PECAN PIE  
More liquid than corn syrup, maple syrup yields a softer, more custardlike pie. Toasted walnuts can be substituted for pecans. We prefer to use Grade B or Grade A dark amber maple syrup for this recipe.  
Reduce butter to 4 tablespoons and pecans to 1-1⁄2 cups. Substitute 1⁄2 cup granulated sugar for brown sugar and 1 cup maple syrup for corn syrup and vanilla.

Remove bowl from skillet and stir in sugar and salt until butter is absorbed. Whisk in eggs, then corn syrup and vanilla until smooth. Return bowl to hot water and stir until mixture is shiny, hot to touch, and registers 130 degrees. Off heat, stir in pecans.  
2. Pour pecan mixture into warm prebaked pie crust. Scatter chocolate over top and lightly press it into filling with back of spoon. Bake pie until filling looks set but yields like Jell-O when gently pressed with back of spoon, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let pie cool on wire rack until filling has set, about 2 hours; serve slightly warm or at room temperature.

VANILLA CREAM PIE  
#quantity  
SERVES 8  
#ingredients  
You can use ALL-BUTTER or “CLASSIC SINGLE-CRUST PIE DOUGH FOR CUSTARD PIES” for this pie. Some tasters preferred a stronger brandy flavor in the filling, so we give a range below. The filling should be warm when poured into the cooled pie crust.  
FILLING  
1⁄2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (4-1⁄3 ounces) granulated sugar  
1⁄4 cup cornstarch  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
1⁄2 cup evaporated milk  
5 large egg yolks  
2 cups whole milk  
1⁄2 vanilla bean  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 2 pieces  
1–2 teaspoons brandy  
1 recipe CLASSIC SINGLE-CRUST PIE DOUGH FOR CUSTARD PIES, fully baked and cooled  
TOPPING  
1 cup heavy cream, chilled  
2 tablespoons confectioners’ sugar  
1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE FILLING: Whisk sugar, cornstarch, and salt together in medium saucepan. Whisk in evaporated milk, followed by egg yolks, and finally milk, until smooth. Cut vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Using tip of paring knife, scrape out seeds, then combine vanilla bean and seeds with sugar mixture. Bring mixture to simmer and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture thickens and becomes smooth, about 1 minute. Off heat, whisk in butter and brandy. Let mixture cool until just warm, stirring often, about 5 minutes.  
2. Remove vanilla bean and pour warm filling into cooled prebaked pie crust. Lay sheet of plastic wrap directly on surface of filling and refrigerate pie until filling is chilled and set, about 4 hours.  
3. FOR THE TOPPING: Once pie is chilled, use stand mixer fitted with whisk to whip cream, sugar, and vanilla on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until soft peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. Spread whipped cream attractively over top of pie.  
BANANA CREAM PIE  
The safest and best place for the banana slices is sandwiched between two layers of filling. If sliced over the pie crust, the bananas tend to moisten the crust; if sliced over the filling top or mashed and folded into the filling, they turn brown faster.  
Pour half of warm filling into cooled prebaked pie crust. Peel 2 bananas and slice thin crosswise over filling. Top with remaining filling. Continue with recipe.

CHOCOLATE CREAM PIE  
#quantity  
SERVES 8  
#ingredients  
Other brands of chocolate sandwich cookies may be substituted for the Oreos, but avoid any “double-filled” cookies because the proportion of cookie to filling won’t be correct. For more information on making a cookie crust, see “MAKING A GRAHAM CRACKER OR COOKIE CRUST”. Do not combine the egg yolks and sugar in advance of making the filling—the sugar will begin to break down the yolks, and the finished cream will be pitted.  
CRUST  
16 Oreo cookies, broken into rough pieces  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled  
FILLING  
2-1⁄2 cups half-and-half  
1⁄3 cup (2-1⁄3 ounces) sugar  
Pinch salt  
6 large egg yolks  
2 tablespoons cornstarch  
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 6 pieces  
6 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, chopped fine  
1 ounce unsweetened chocolate, chopped fine  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
TOPPING  
1-1⁄2 cups heavy cream, chilled  
2 tablespoons sugar  
1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CRUST: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Pulse cookies in food processor until coarsely ground, about 15 pulses, then continue to process to fine, even crumbs, about 15 seconds. Sprinkle melted butter over crumbs and pulse to incorporate, about 5 pulses.  
2. Sprinkle mixture into 9-inch pie plate. Using bottom of measuring cup, press crumbs into even layer on bottom and sides of pie plate. Bake until crust is fragrant and looks set, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer pie plate to wire rack and let crust cool completely.  
3. FOR THE FILLING: Bring half-and-half, 3 tablespoons sugar, and salt to simmer in medium saucepan, stirring occasionally.  
4. As half-and-half mixture begins to simmer, whisk egg yolks, cornstarch, and remaining sugar together in medium bowl until smooth. Slowly whisk 1 cup of simmering half-and-half mixture into yolk mixture to temper, then slowly whisk tempered yolk mixture back into remaining half-and-half mixture. Reduce heat to medium and cook, whisking vigorously, until mixture is thickened and few bubbles burst on surface, about 30 seconds. Off heat, whisk in butter, semisweet chocolate, and unsweetened chocolate until completely smooth and melted, then stir in vanilla.  
5. Pour warm filling into cooled prebaked pie crust. Lay sheet of plastic wrap directly on surface of filling and refrigerate pie until filling is chilled and set, about 4 hours.  
6. FOR THE TOPPING: Once pie is chilled, use stand mixer fitted with whisk to whip cream, sugar, and vanilla on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until soft peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. Spread whipped cream attractively over top of pie.

COCONUT CREAM PIE  
#quantity  
SERVES 8  
#ingredients  
Do not use light coconut milk here because it does not have enough flavor. Also, don’t confuse coconut milk with cream of coconut. The filling should be warm when poured into the cooled pie crust. To toast the coconut, place it in a small skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring often, for 3 to 5 minutes. It burns quite easily, so keep a close eye on it.  
FILLING  
1 (14-ounce) can coconut milk  
1 cup whole milk  
2⁄3 cup (4-2⁄3 ounces) sugar  
1⁄2 cup (1-1⁄4 ounces) unsweetened shredded coconut  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
5 large egg yolks  
1⁄4 cup cornstarch  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 2 pieces  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
1 recipe GRAHAM CRACKER CRUST, baked and cooled  
TOPPING  
1-1⁄2 cups heavy cream, chilled  
1-1⁄2 tablespoons sugar  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons dark rum (optional)  
1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1 tablespoon unsweetened shredded coconut, toasted  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE FILLING: Bring coconut milk, whole milk, 1⁄3 cup sugar, shredded coconut, and salt to simmer in medium saucepan, stirring occasionally.  
2. As milk mixture begins to simmer, whisk egg yolks, cornstarch, and remaining 1⁄3 cup sugar together in medium bowl until smooth. Slowly whisk 1 cup of simmering coconut milk mixture into yolk mixture to temper, then slowly whisk tempered yolk mixture back into remaining coconut milk mixture. Reduce heat to medium and cook, whisking vigorously, until mixture is thickened and few bubbles burst on surface, about 30 seconds. Off heat, whisk in butter and vanilla. Let mixture cool until just warm, stirring often, about 5 minutes.  
3. Pour warm filling into cooled prebaked pie crust. Lay sheet of plastic wrap directly on surface of filling and refrigerate pie until filling is chilled and set, about 4 hours.  
4. FOR THE TOPPING: Before serving, using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip cream, sugar, rum, if using, and vanilla together on medium-low speed until frothy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and continue to whip until soft peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. Spread whipped cream attractively over top of pie and sprinkle with toasted coconut.  
LIME-COCONUT CREAM PIE  
Whisk 1-1⁄2 teaspoons grated lime zest into filling along with vanilla and butter.  
BANANA-CARAMEL COCONUT CREAM PIE  
This variation is a test kitchen favorite. Light coconut milk lacks rich coconut flavor, so skip it in favor of regular coconut milk. You may be left with 1⁄3 cup or so of filling that will not fit into the crust because of the caramel and banana.  
#instructions  
1. Add 3 tablespoons water to small saucepan, then pour 1⁄2 cup sugar into center of saucepan. Gently stir sugar with clean spatula to wet thoroughly. Bring to boil and cook until sugar mixture turns dark amber, 5 to 8 minutes, swirling pan occasionally once sugar begins to color. Off heat, add 3 tablespoons heavy cream (caramel will bubble vigorously) and pinch salt; whisk to combine. Whisk in 2 tablespoons unsalted butter. Pour caramel into cooled prebaked pie crust, tilting pie plate to coat evenly; set aside to cool. When caramel is cool, peel 2 slightly underripe bananas and slice crosswise 1⁄4 inch thick. Arrange slices in single layer on top of caramel.  
2. Whisk 2 teaspoons dark rum into filling along with butter and vanilla and pour filling over sliced bananas. Continue with recipe.

KEY LIME PIE  
#quantity  
SERVES 8  
#ingredients  
Despite this pie’s name, we found that most tasters could not tell the difference between pies made with regular supermarket limes (called Persian limes) and true Key limes. Since Persian limes are easier to find and juice, we recommend them. The timing here is different from other pies; you need to make the filling first, then prepare the crust.  
PIE  
4 large egg yolks  
4 teaspoons grated lime zest plus 1⁄2 cup juice (5 limes)  
1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk  
1 recipe GRAHAM CRACKER CRUST  
TOPPING (OPTIONAL)  
1 cup heavy cream, chilled  
1⁄4 cup (1 ounce) confectioners’ sugar  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE PIE: Whisk egg yolks and lime zest together in medium bowl until mixture has light green tint, about 2 minutes. Whisk in condensed milk until smooth, then whisk in lime juice. Cover mixture and set aside at room temperature until thickened, about 30 minutes.  
2. Meanwhile, prepare and bake crust. Transfer pie plate to wire rack and leave oven at 325 degrees. (Crust must still be warm when filling is added.)  
3. Pour thickened filling into warm prebaked pie crust. Bake pie until center is firm but jiggles slightly when shaken, 15 to 20 minutes. Let pie cool slightly on wire rack, about 1 hour, then cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate until filling is chilled and set, about 3 hours.  
4. FOR THE TOPPING, IF USING: Once pie is chilled, use stand mixer fitted with whisk to whip cream and sugar on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until soft peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. Spread whipped cream attractively over top of pie.

As soon as the filling is made, cover it with plastic wrap to keep it hot and then start working on the meringue topping. You want to add hot filling to the cooled pie crust, apply the meringue topping, and then quickly get the pie into the oven.  
FILLING  
1-1⁄2 cups water  
1 cup (7 ounces) sugar  
1⁄4 cup cornstarch  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
6 large egg yolks  
1 tablespoon grated lemon zest plus 1⁄2 cup juice (3 lemons)  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 2 pieces

1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1⁄4 teaspoon cream of tartar  
1⁄2 cup (3-1⁄2 ounces) sugar  
1 recipe CLASSIC SINGLE-CRUST PIE DOUGH FOR CUSTARD PIES, fully baked and cooled  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE FILLING: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Bring water, sugar, cornstarch, and salt to simmer in large saucepan, whisking constantly. When mixture starts to turn translucent, whisk in egg yolks, two at a time. Whisk in lemon zest and juice and butter. Return mixture to brief simmer, then remove from heat. Lay sheet of plastic wrap directly on surface of filling to keep warm and prevent skin from forming.  
2. FOR THE MERINGUE: Bring water and cornstarch to simmer in small saucepan and cook, whisking occasionally, until thickened and translucent, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.  
3. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip egg whites, vanilla, and cream of tartar on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and whip whites to soft, billowy mounds, about 1 minute. Gradually add sugar and whip until glossy, stiff peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes.  
4. Meanwhile, remove plastic from filling and return to very low heat during last minute or so of beating meringue (to ensure filling is hot).  
5. Pour warm filling into cooled prebaked pie crust. Using rubber spatula, immediately distribute meringue evenly around edge and then center of pie, attaching meringue to pie crust to prevent shrinking. Using back of spoon, create attractive swirls and peaks in meringue. Bake until meringue is light golden brown, about 20 minutes. Let pie cool on wire rack until filling has set, about 2 hours. Serve.  
APPLYING A MERINGUE TOPPING

TARTE TATIN  
#quantity  
SERVES 8  
#ingredients  
Make sure that the caramel doesn’t get too brown before adding the apples in step 5; it should be just golden. Be sure to let the tart rest for 30 minutes before serving, or it will likely break into pieces when you unmold it.  
DOUGH  
1-1⁄3 cups (6-2⁄3 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄4 cup (1 ounce) confectioners’ sugar  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄4-inch pieces and chilled  
1 large egg, lightly beaten  
APPLES  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter  
3⁄4 cup (5-1⁄4 ounces) granulated sugar  
3 pounds Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, and quartered  
TOPPING  
1 cup heavy cream, chilled  
1⁄2 cup sour cream, chilled  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE DOUGH: Process flour, sugar, and salt together in food processor until combined, about 5 seconds. Scatter butter over top and pulse until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, about 15 pulses. With machine running, add egg and continue to process until dough just comes together around processor blade, about 12 seconds.  
2. Turn dough onto sheet of plastic wrap and flatten into 6-inch disk. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour. Before rolling dough out, let it sit on counter to soften slightly, about 10 minutes. (Dough can be wrapped tightly in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 1 month. If frozen, let dough thaw completely on counter before rolling it out.)  
3. Roll dough into 14-inch circle on lightly floured counter, then transfer to parchment paper–lined baking sheet; cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed.  
4. FOR THE APPLES: Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Melt butter in 12-inch ovensafe nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in sugar and cook until mixture is light golden, 2 to 4 minutes.  
5. Off heat, place first apple quarter cut side down, with end touching skillet wall. Continue to arrange apples, lifting each quarter on its edge and placing next apple quarter on its edge, so that apples stand straight up on cut edge. Fill skillet middle with remaining quarters, halved if necessary. Cook apples over medium heat until they are lightly golden and caramel is darkly colored, about 6 minutes, turning apples over halfway through cooking.  
6. Off heat, slide chilled dough over apples in skillet. Being careful not to burn fingers, fold back edge of dough so that it fits snugly into skillet. Transfer skillet to oven and bake tart until crust is golden brown, about 20 minutes, rotating skillet halfway through baking.  
7. Using potholder (skillet handle will be hot), remove skillet from oven. Let tart cool in skillet for 30 minutes. Run small knife around edge, place inverted serving platter (or cutting board) over top and gently flip tart onto platter, using mitts or kitchen towels if skillet is still hot. Scrape out any apples that stick to skillet and put them back into place on tart.  
8. FOR THE TOPPING: Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip cream and sour cream on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until soft peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. Serve individual portions with dollop of topping.

APPLE GALETTE  
#quantity  
SERVES 10 TO 12  
#ingredients  
The most common brands of instant flour are Wondra and Shake & Blend; they are sold in canisters in the baking aisle. The galette can be made without instant flour, using 2 cups all-purpose flour and 2 tablespoons cornstarch; however, you might have to increase the amount of ice water. For more information on mixing the tart dough in step 2, see FRAISAGE OR MIXING FLAKY TART DOUGH. Serve with vanilla ice cream, WHIPPED CREAM or TANGY WHIPPED CREAM. If you choose to make the tangy whipped cream, make it before starting the galette because it must stand at room temperature for about 1-1⁄2 hours before serving.  
DOUGH  
1-1⁄2 cups (7-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄2 cup (2-1⁄2 ounces) instant flour  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
1⁄2 teaspoon sugar  
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄4-inch pieces and chilled  
7–9 tablespoons ice water  
TOPPING  
1-1⁄2 pounds Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, halved, and sliced 1⁄8-inch thick  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄4-inch pieces  
1⁄4 cup (1-3⁄4 ounces) sugar  
3 tablespoons apple jelly  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE DOUGH: Process all-purpose flour, instant flour, salt, and sugar together in food processor until combined, about 5 seconds. Scatter butter over top and pulse until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, about 15 pulses. Continue to pulse, adding water 1 tablespoon at a time until dough begins to form small curds that hold together when pinched with fingers (dough will be crumbly), about 10 pulses.  
2. Turn dough crumbs onto lightly floured counter and gather into rectangular-shaped pile. Starting at farthest end, use heel of hand to smear small amount of dough against counter. Continue to smear dough until all crumbs have been worked. Gather smeared crumbs together in another rectangular-shaped pile and repeat process. Press dough into 4-inch square, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hour. Before rolling dough out, let it sit on counter to soften slightly, about 10 minutes. (Dough can be wrapped tightly in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 1 month. If frozen, let dough thaw completely on counter before rolling it out.)  
3. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Cut piece of parchment paper to measure exactly 16 by 12 inches. Roll dough out over parchment, dusting with flour as needed, until it just overhangs parchment. Trim edges of dough even with parchment. Roll outer 1 inch of dough up to create 1⁄2-inch-thick border. Slide parchment with dough onto baking sheet.  
4. FOR THE TOPPING: Starting in 1 corner of tart, shingle apple slices into crust in tidy diagonal rows, overlapping them by one-third. Dot with butter and sprinkle evenly with sugar. Bake tart until bottom is deep golden brown and apples have caramelized, 45 minutes to 1 hour, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking.  
5. Melt jelly in small saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to smooth out any lumps. Brush glaze over apples and let tart cool slightly on sheet for 10 minutes. Slide tart onto large platter or cutting board and slice tart in half lengthwise, then crosswise into square pieces. Serve warm or at room temperature.

CLASSIC TART DOUGH  
#quantity  
MAKES ENOUGH FOR ONE 9-INCH TART  
#ingredients  
Tart crust is sweeter, crispier, and less flaky than pie crust—it is more similar in texture to a cookie.  
1 large egg yolk  
1 tablespoon heavy cream  
1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1-1⁄4 cups (6-1⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour  
2⁄3 cup (2-2⁄3 ounces) confectioners’ sugar  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄4-inch pieces and chilled  
#instructions  
1. Whisk egg yolk, cream, and vanilla together in bowl. Process flour, sugar, and salt together in food processor until combined, about 5 seconds. Scatter butter over top and pulse until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, about 15 pulses. With machine running, add egg mixture and continue to process until dough just comes together around processor blade, about 12 seconds.  
2. Turn dough onto sheet of plastic wrap and flatten into 6-inch disk. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour. Before rolling dough out, let it sit on counter to soften slightly, about 10 minutes. (Dough can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 1 month. If frozen, let dough thaw completely on counter before rolling it out.)  
3. Roll dough into 11-inch circle on lightly floured counter (if at any point dough becomes too soft and sticky to work with, slip dough onto baking sheet and freeze or refrigerate until workable). Place dough round on baking sheet, cover with plastic, and refrigerate for about 30 minutes.  
4. Remove dough from refrigerator; discard plastic but keep dough on baking sheet. Loosely roll dough around rolling pin and gently unroll it onto 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom, letting excess dough hang over edge. Ease dough into pan by gently lifting edge of dough with 1 hand while pressing into corners with other hand. Leave any dough that overhangs pan in place.  
5. Press dough into fluted sides of pan, forming distinct seam around pan’s circumference. (If some sections of edge are too thin, reinforce them by folding excess dough back on itself.) Run rolling pin over top of tart pan to remove any excess dough. Wrap dough-lined tart pan loosely in plastic, place on large plate, and freeze until dough is fully chilled and firm, about 30 minutes, before using. (Dough-lined tart pan can be wrapped tightly in plastic and frozen for up to 1 month.)  
6. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Set dough-lined tart pan on rimmed baking sheet. Spray 1 side of double layer of aluminum foil with vegetable oil spray. Press foil greased side down into frozen tart shell, covering edges to prevent burning, and fill with pie weights.  
7A. FOR A PARTIALLY BAKED SHELL: Bake until tart shell is golden brown and set, about 30 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. Transfer tart shell with baking sheet to wire rack and carefully remove weights and foil. Use crust while it is still warm or let it cool completely .  
7B. FOR A FULLY BAKED SHELL: Bake until tart shell is golden brown and set, about 30 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. Carefully remove weights and foil and continue to bake tart shell until it is fully baked and golden, 5 to 10 minutes longer. Transfer tart shell with baking sheet to wire rack and let tart shell cool completely, about 1 hour.

1 recipe CLASSIC TART DOUGH, fully baked and cooled  
2 large kiwis, peeled, halved lengthwise, and sliced 3⁄8 inch thick  
10 ounces (2 cups) raspberries  
5 ounces (1 cup) blueberries  
1⁄2 cup red currant or apple jelly  
#instructions  
1. Bring half-and-half, 6 tablespoons sugar, and salt to simmer in medium saucepan, stirring occasionally.  
2. As half-and-half mixture begins to simmer, whisk egg yolks, cornstarch, and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar together in medium bowl until smooth. Slowly whisk 1 cup of simmering half-and-half mixture into yolk mixture to temper, then slowly whisk tempered yolk mixture back into remaining half-and-half mixture. Reduce heat to medium and cook, whisking vigorously, until mixture is thickened and few bubbles burst on surface, about 30 seconds. Off heat, whisk in butter and vanilla. Transfer mixture to clean bowl, lay sheet of plastic wrap directly on surface, and refrigerate pastry cream until chilled and firm, about 3 hours. (Pastry cream can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.)  
3. Spread chilled pastry cream evenly over bottom of cooled prebaked tart shell. Shingle kiwi slices around edge of tart, then arrange 3 rows of raspberries inside kiwi. Finally, arrange mound of blueberries in center.  
4. Melt jelly in small saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to smooth out any lumps. Using pastry brush, dab melted jelly over fruit. To serve, remove outer metal ring of tart pan, slide thin metal spatula between tart and tart pan bottom, and carefully slide tart onto serving platter or cutting board.

POACHED PEAR AND ALMOND TART  
#quantity  
SERVES 8 TO 10  
#ingredients  
If you cannot find blanched slivered almonds, use whole blanched almonds, but chop them coarse before processing to make sure they form a fine, even grind. The pears should be ripe but firm, the flesh, near the stem, giving slightly when gently pressed with a finger. Purchase the pears a few days ahead and allow them to ripen at room temperature. If they ripen before you need them, refrigerate them and use them within a day or two, or poach them and hold them in their syrup (they will keep for about 3 days). Many tasters liked the bright, crisp flavor of pears poached in Sauvignon Blanc. Chardonnay-poached pears had deeper, oakier flavors and were also well liked.  
POACHED PEARS  
1 (750-ml) bottle white wine  
2⁄3 cup (4-2⁄3 ounces) sugar  
5 (2-inch) strips lemon zest plus 2 tablespoons juice  
1 cinnamon stick  
15 whole peppercorns  
3 whole cloves  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
1⁄2 vanilla bean (optional)  
4 Bosc or Bartlett pears (8 ounces each), peeled, halved, and cored  
FILLING AND GLAZE  
1 cup blanched slivered almonds  
1⁄2 cup (3-1⁄2 ounces) sugar  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
1 large egg plus 1 large white  
1⁄2 teaspoon almond extract  
1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 6 pieces and softened  
1 recipe CLASSIC TART DOUGH, partially baked and cooled  
1⁄4 cup apple jelly  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE POACHED PEARS: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Combine wine, sugar, lemon zest and juice, cinnamon stick, peppercorns, cloves, and salt in large saucepan. If using, cut vanilla bean in half lengthwise, then, using tip of paring knife, scrape out seeds, and add seeds and pod to saucepan. Bring mixture to simmer, stirring occasionally to dissolve sugar. Slide pear halves into simmering wine mixture; return to simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and poach pears, turning them occasionally, until tender and skewer can be inserted into pear with very little resistance about 10 minutes. Off heat, let pears cool in liquid, partially covered, until pears have turned translucent and are cool enough to handle, about 1 hour. (Pears and liquid can be transferred to bowl, cooled to room temperature, covered, and refrigerated for up to 3 days.)  
2. FOR THE ALMOND FILLING: Pulse almonds, sugar, and salt in food processor until finely ground, about 25 pulses. Continue to process until nut mixture is as finely ground as possible, about 10 seconds. Add egg and egg white, almond extract, and vanilla and process until combined, about 10 seconds. Add butter and process until no lumps remain, about 20 seconds, scraping down bowl as needed. (Filling can transferred to bowl, covered, and refrigerated for up to 3 days. Before using, let stand at room temperature about 30 minutes to soften, stirring 3 or 4 times.)  
3. Spread filling evenly over bottom of cooled, partially baked tart shell. Remove pears from poaching liquid and pat dry with paper towels. Cut poached pear half crosswise into 3⁄8-inch slices, leaving pear half intact on cutting board (do not separate slices). Pat dry again with paper towels to absorb excess moisture. Discard first 4 slices from narrow end of sliced pear half. Slide spatula under sliced pear and, steadying it with 1 hand, slide pear off spatula onto center of tart. Cut and dry another pear half. Slide spatula under pear and gently press pear to fan slices toward narrow end. Slide fanned pear half onto filling, narrow end toward center, almost touching center pear. Repeat slicing, fanning, and placing remaining pear halves, spacing them evenly and making flower petal pattern off center pear.  
4. Bake tart on baking sheet until crust is deep golden brown and almond filling is puffed, browned, and firm to the touch, about 45 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. Transfer tart with baking sheet to wire rack and let cool for 10 minutes.  
5. Melt jelly in small saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to smooth out lumps. Using pastry brush, dab melted jelly over fruit. Let tart cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. To serve, remove outer metal ring of tart pan, slide thin metal spatula between tart and tart pan bottom, and carefully slide tart onto serving platter or cutting board.

LINZERTORTE  
#quantity  
SERVES 10 TO 12  
#ingredients  
Make sure to buy blanched almonds. Be sure to use an 11-inch tart pan here. You will have some extra dough when cutting out the lattice strips; we suggest cutting out a few extra lattice strips as backup (they can be delicate and will sometimes break). If at any time while forming the lattice the dough becomes too soft, refrigerate it for 15 minutes before continuing. The linzertorte may be served at room temperature the day it is baked, but it is at its best after a night in the refrigerator.  
TART DOUGH  
1 large egg  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1 cup hazelnuts, toasted and skinned  
1⁄2 cup blanched almonds  
1⁄2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (4-1⁄3 ounces) sugar  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest  
1-1⁄2 cups (7-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
1⁄8 teaspoon ground allspice  
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces and chilled  
FILLING AND GLAZE  
1-1⁄4 cups raspberry preserves  
1 tablespoon lemon juice  
1 tablespoon heavy cream  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons turbinado or Demerara sugar (optional)  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE TART DOUGH: Whisk egg and vanilla together in bowl. Process hazelnuts, almonds, sugar, and salt in food processor until very finely ground, 45 to 60 seconds. Add lemon zest and pulse to combine, about 5 pulses. Add flour, cinnamon, and allspice and pulse to combine, about 5 pulses. Scatter butter over top and pulse until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, about 15 pulses. With machine running, add egg mixture and continue to process until dough just comes together around processor blade, about 12 seconds.  
2. Turn dough onto counter and press together to form cohesive mound. Divide dough in half and flatten each piece into 5-inch disk; if not using immediately, wrap each piece tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate up to 48 hours. (If refrigerated until firm, let dough sit at room temperature until soft and malleable, about 1 hour.)  
3. Tear 1 piece of dough into walnut-size pieces, then pat it into 11-inch tart pan with removable bottom, pressing it 3⁄4 inch up sides of pan. Lay plastic over dough and smooth out any bumps using bottom of measuring cup. Set tart pan on large plate and freeze until dough is fully chilled and firm, about 30 minutes.  
4. Roll other piece of dough into 12-inch square between 2 large sheets of floured parchment paper. (If dough sticks to parchment, gently loosen and lift sticky area with bench scraper and dust parchment with additional flour. Slide dough, still between parchment sheets, onto rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes.) Remove top layer of parchment and trim edges of dough, then cut ten 3⁄4-inch-wide strips, cutting through underlying parchment. Cover with parchment and freeze until dough is fully chilled and firm, about 20 minutes.  
5. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Set dough-lined tart pan on rimmed baking sheet. Spray 1 side of double layer of aluminum foil with vegetable oil spray. Press foil greased side down into frozen tart shell, covering edges to prevent burning, and fill with pie weights. Bake until tart shell is golden brown and set, about 30 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. Transfer tart shell with baking sheet to wire rack, carefully remove weights, and let cool slightly while making filling.  
6. FOR THE FILLING AND GLAZE: Stir raspberry preserves and lemon juice together in bowl, then spread evenly over bottom of cooled prebaked tart shell. Pick up strip of dough by parchment ends, then flip it over onto tart, positioning it near edge of pan. Remove parchment strip and trim ends of dough strip by pressing down on top edge of pan; reserve all dough scraps. Place 2 more strips parallel to first, spacing them evenly so that one is across center and other is near opposite edge of pan. Rotate pan 90 degrees, then place 3 more strips as you did first 3. Rotate pan 90 degrees again, then place 2 strips across pan, spaced evenly between first 3. Rotate pan again and complete lattice by placing last 2 strips between second set of 3. Use small scraps of dough to fill in crust around edges between lattice strips. Top of crust should be just below top of pan.  
7. Gently brush lattice strips with heavy cream and sprinkle with turbinado sugar, if using. Bake tart on baking sheet until crust is deep golden brown, about 50 minutes. Transfer tart with baking sheet to wire rack and let cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. To serve, remove outer metal ring of tart pan, slide thin metal spatula between tart and tart pan bottom, and carefully slide tart onto serving platter or cutting board.  
ASSEMBLING A LINZERTORTE  
#instructions  
1. After chilling dough square, trim any rough edges, then cut square into 10 strips, each 3⁄4 inch wide, cutting through underlying parchment paper.  
2. Place parchment-lined strip of dough over tart and peel off parchment; trim ends of dough. Place 2 more strips parallel to first, spacing them evenly.  
3. Place remaining 8 dough strips on tart, rotating pan as needed to form lattice top.  
4. Using scraps of dough, fill in crust around edges between lattice strips.

CARAMEL-WALNUT FILLING  
1⁄4 cup water  
1 cup (7 ounces) granulated sugar  
2⁄3 cup heavy cream  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 3 pieces  
1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1⁄2 teaspoon lemon juice  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
16–18 walnut halves, plus 1 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped coarse  
CHOCOLATE FILLING  
2 large egg yolks  
1 tablespoon plus 1⁄3 cup heavy cream  
1⁄3 cup whole milk  
5 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped fine  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CRUST: Whisk egg and vanilla together in bowl. Process nuts and sugar in food processor until finely ground, 8 to 10 seconds. Add flour and salt and pulse to combine, about 5 pulses. Scatter butter over top and pulse until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, about 15 pulses. With machine running, add egg mixture and continue to process until dough just comes together around processor blade, about 20 seconds.  
2. Turn dough onto sheet of plastic wrap and flatten into 6-inch disk. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour. Before rolling dough out, let it sit on counter to soften slightly, about 10 minutes. (Dough can be wrapped tightly in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 1 month. If frozen, let dough thaw completely on counter before rolling it out.)  
3. Roll dough into 11-inch circle on lightly floured counter (if at any point dough becomes too soft and sticky to work with, slip dough onto baking sheet and freeze or refrigerate until workable). Place dough round on baking sheet, cover with plastic, and refrigerate for about 30 minutes.  
4. Remove dough from refrigerator; discard plastic but keep dough on baking sheet. Loosely roll dough around rolling pin and gently unroll it onto 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom, letting excess dough hang over edge. Ease dough into pan by gently lifting edge of dough with 1 hand while pressing into corners with other hand. Leave any dough that overhangs pan in place.  
5. Press dough into fluted sides of pan, forming distinct seam around pan’s circumference. (If some sections of edge are too thin, reinforce them by folding excess dough back on itself.) Run rolling pin over top of tart pan to remove any excess dough. Wrap dough-lined tart pan loosely in plastic, place on large plate, and freeze until dough is fully chilled and firm, about 30 minutes, before using. (Dough-lined tart pan can be wrapped tightly in plastic and frozen for up to 1 month.)  
6. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Set dough-lined tart pan on rimmed baking sheet. Spray 1 side of double layer of aluminum foil with vegetable oil spray. Press foil greased side down into frozen tart shell, covering edges to prevent burning, and fill with pie weights. Bake until tart shell is golden brown and set, about 30 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. Transfer tart shell with baking sheet to wire rack, carefully remove weights, and let cool slightly while making filling. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees.  
7. FOR THE CARAMEL FILLING: While crust is cooling, add water to medium saucepan, then pour sugar into center of saucepan (don’t let it hit pan sides). Gently stir sugar with clean spatula to wet it thoroughly. Bring to boil and cook, without stirring, until sugar has dissolved completely and liquid has faint golden color (about 300 degrees), 6 to 10 minutes.  
8. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until caramel has dark amber color (about 350 degrees), 1 to 3 minutes. Off heat, slowly whisk in cream until combined (mixture will bubble and steam vigorously). Stir in butter, vanilla, lemon juice, and salt until combined. Stir in walnut halves to coat. Let caramel mixture sit until slightly thickened, about 8 minutes.  
9. Set wire rack over piece of parchment paper. Using slotted spoon, transfer caramel-coated walnuts to rack, flip nuts right side up, and let cool completely. Stir chopped walnuts into caramel, then pour caramel mixture into cooled prebaked tart shell. Refrigerate tart, uncovered, until caramel is firm and does not run when pan is tilted, about 20 minutes.  
10. FOR THE CHOCOLATE FILLING: While caramel sets, whisk egg yolks and 1 tablespoon cream together in bowl. Bring milk and remaining 1⁄3 cup cream to simmer in a small saucepan. Off heat, stir in chocolate and butter, cover saucepan, and let stand until chocolate is mostly melted, about 2 minutes. Gently stir mixture until smooth, then stir in egg yolk mixture. Pour chocolate filling evenly over chilled caramel in tart shell and smooth into even layer by tilting pan. Bake tart on baking sheet until tiny bubbles are visible on surface and chocolate layer is just set, about 25 minutes.  
11. Transfer tart with baking sheet to wire rack and arrange caramel-coated walnut halves around edge of tart to garnish. Let tart cool slightly on baking sheet for 30 minutes, then refrigerate, uncovered, until chocolate is firm, about 3 hours. To serve, remove outer metal ring of tart pan, slide thin metal spatula between tart and tart pan bottom, and carefully slide tart onto serving platter or cutting board.

Taste the fruit before adding sugar to it; use the lesser amount if the fruit is very sweet, more if it is tart. However much sugar you use, do not add it to the fruit until you are ready to fill and form the tart. Serve with vanilla ice cream or WHIPPED CREAM.  
DOUGH  
1-1⁄2 cups (7-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
10 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces and chilled  
4–6 tablespoons ice water  
FILLING  
1 pound peaches, nectarines, apricots, or plums, halved, pitted, and cut into 1⁄2-inch wedges  
5 ounces (1 cup) blueberries, raspberries, or blackberries  
3–5 tablespoons plus 1 tablespoon sugar  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE DOUGH: Process flour and salt in food processor until combined, about 5 seconds. Scatter butter over top and pulse until mixture resembles coarse bread crumbs and butter pieces are about size of small peas, about 10 pulses. Continue to pulse, adding water 1 tablespoon at a time, until dough begins to form small curds that hold together when pinched with fingers (dough will be crumbly), about 10 pulses.  
2. Turn dough crumbs onto lightly floured counter and gather into rectangular-shaped pile. Starting at farthest end, use heel of hand to smear small amount of dough against counter. Continue to smear dough until all crumbs have been worked. Gather smeared crumbs together in another rectangular-shaped pile and repeat process. Press dough into 6-inch disk, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hour. Before rolling dough out, let it sit on counter to soften slightly, about 10 minutes. (Dough can be wrapped tightly in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 1 month. If frozen, let dough thaw completely on counter before rolling it out.)  
3. Roll dough into 12-inch circle between 2 large sheets of floured parchment paper. (If dough sticks to parchment, gently loosen and lift sticky area with bench scraper and dust parchment with additional flour.) Slide dough, still between parchment sheets, onto rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate until firm, 15 to 30 minutes. (If refrigerated longer and dough is hard and brittle, let stand at room temperature until pliant.)  
4. FOR THE FILLING: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Gently toss fruit and 3 to 5 tablespoons sugar together in bowl. Remove top sheet of parchment paper from dough. Mound fruit in center of dough, leaving 2-1⁄2-inch border around edge of fruit.

Divide dough into 4 equal portions before rolling out in step 3. Roll each portion into 7-inch circle on parchment paper; stack rounds and refrigerate until firm. Continue with recipe from step 4, mounding one-quarter of fruit in center of dough round, leaving 1-1⁄2-inch border around edge. Being careful to leave 1⁄4-inch border of dough around edge of fruit, fold outermost 1 to 1-1⁄4 inches of dough over fruit. Transfer parchment with tart to rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining fruit and dough. Brush dough with water and sprinkle each tartlet with portion of remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake until crust is deep golden brown and fruit is bubbling, 40 to 45 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking.  
MAKING A FREE-FORM TART

#ingredients  
Preparing the fruit first gives it time to release its juices.  
FRUIT  
2-1⁄2 pounds strawberries, hulled (8 cups)  
6 tablespoons sugar  
BISCUITS  
2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour  
5 tablespoons (2-1⁄4 ounces) sugar  
1 tablespoon baking powder  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces and chilled  
1⁄2 cup plus 1 tablespoon half-and-half or milk  
1 large egg, lightly beaten, plus 1 large white, lightly beaten  
WHIPPED CREAM  
1 cup heavy cream, chilled  
1 tablespoon sugar  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE FRUIT: Crush 3 cups strawberries in large bowl with potato masher. Slice remaining 5 cups berries. Stir sliced berries and sugar into crushed berries. Set aside until sugar has dissolved and berries are juicy, at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.  
2. FOR THE BISCUITS: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Pulse flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, and salt in food processor until combined. Scatter butter pieces over top and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal, about 15 pulses. Transfer mixture to large bowl.  
3. Whisk half-and-half and whole egg together in bowl, then stir into flour mixture until large clumps form. Turn out onto lightly floured counter and knead lightly until dough comes together (do not overwork dough).  
4. Pat dough into 9 by 6-inch rectangle, about 3⁄4 inch thick. Using floured 2-3⁄4-inch biscuit cutter, cut out 6 dough rounds. Arrange biscuits on prepared sheet, spaced about 1-1⁄2 inches apart. Brush tops with egg white and sprinkle evenly with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. (Unbaked biscuits can be refrigerated, covered with plastic wrap, for up to 2 hours.)  
5. Bake until biscuits are golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. Transfer baking sheet to wire rack and let biscuits cool, about 10 minutes. (Cooled biscuits can be stored at room temperature for up to 1 day. Before assembling, reheat in 350-degree oven for 3 to 5 minutes.)  
6. FOR THE WHIPPED CREAM: Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip cream, sugar, and vanilla on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until soft peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes.  
7. To assemble, split each biscuit in half and place bottoms on individual plates. Spoon portion of berries over each bottom, dollop with whipped cream, and cap with biscuit tops. Serve immediately.  
MASHING STRAWBERRIES FOR SHORTCAKES  
For best flavor and appearance, crush a portion of the berries for the filling with a potato masher to create a thick puree that will anchor the remaining sliced berries to the biscuits.

PEACH SHORTCAKES

SERVES 6  
#ingredients  
This recipe works well with any peaches, regardless of quality. If your peaches are firm, you should be able to peel them with a sharp vegetable peeler. If they are too soft to withstand the pressure of a peeler, you’ll need to blanch them in a pot of simmering water for 15 seconds and then shock them in a bowl of ice water before peeling. You can substitute 1⁄2 cup low-fat yogurt mixed with 3 tablespoons of milk for the buttermilk, if desired. Orange juice or orange liqueur can be used in place of the peach schnapps.  
FRUIT  
2 pounds peaches, peeled, halved, pitted, and cut into 1⁄4-inch wedges  
6 tablespoons sugar  
2 tablespoons peach schnapps  
BISCUITS  
2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour  
2 tablespoons sugar  
2 teaspoons baking powder  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
2⁄3 cup buttermilk, chilled  
1 large egg  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled  
WHIPPED CREAM  
1⁄2 cup heavy cream, chilled  
1 tablespoon sugar  
1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE FRUIT: Gently toss three-quarters of peaches with 4 tablespoons sugar in large bowl. Let sit 30 minutes. Toss remaining peaches with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and schnapps in medium bowl. Microwave until peaches are bubbling, about 1 to 1-1⁄2 minutes, stirring twice. Using potato masher, crush peaches into coarse pulp. Let sit 30 minutes.  
2. FOR THE BISCUITS: Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 475 degrees. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, baking powder, and salt together in large bowl. Whisk buttermilk and egg together in bowl; add melted butter and stir until butter forms small clumps.  
3. Add buttermilk mixture to dry ingredients and stir with wooden spoon until dough comes together and no dry flour remains. Continue to stir vigorously for 30 seconds. Using greased 1⁄3-cup measure, portion dough onto prepared baking sheet to create 6 biscuits, spaced about 1-1⁄2 inches apart. Sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon sugar evenly over top of biscuits. Bake until tops are golden brown and crisp, about 15 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. Transfer baking sheet to wire rack and let cool, about 15 minutes. (Cooled biscuits can be stored at room temperature for up to 1 day. Reheat in 350-degree oven for 3 to 5 minutes before assembling.)  
4. FOR THE WHIPPED CREAM: Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip cream, sugar, and vanilla on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until soft peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes.  
5. To assemble, split each biscuit in half and place bottoms on individual plates. Spoon portion of crushed peach mixture over each bottom, followed by peach slices and juices. Dollop each shortcake with 2 tablespoons whipped cream, cap with biscuit tops, and dollop with remaining whipped cream. Serve immediately.

BERRY FOOL  
#quantity  
SERVES 6  
#ingredients  
Blueberries or blackberries can be substituted for the raspberries in this recipe. You may also substitute frozen fruit for fresh, but it will slightly compromise the texture. If using frozen fruit, reduce the amount of sugar in the puree by 1 tablespoon. The thickened fruit puree can be made up to 4 hours in advance; just make sure to whisk it well in step 4 to break up any clumps before combining it with the whipped cream. For the best results, chill your beater and bowl before whipping the cream. We like the granular texture and nutty flavor of Carr’s Whole Wheat Crackers, but graham crackers or gingersnaps will also work. You will need six tall parfait or sundae glasses for this recipe.  
2 pounds strawberries, hulled (6 cups)  
12 ounces (2-1⁄3 cups) raspberries  
3⁄4 cup sugar  
2 teaspoons unflavored gelatin  
1 cup heavy cream, chilled  
1⁄4 cup sour cream, chilled  
1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
4 Carr’s Whole Wheat Crackers, crushed fine (1⁄4 cup)  
6 sprigs fresh mint (optional)  
#instructions  
1. Process half of strawberries, half of raspberries, and 1⁄2 cup sugar in food processor until mixture is completely smooth, about 1 minute. Strain berry puree through fine-mesh strainer into large liquid measuring cup (you should have about 2-1⁄2 cups puree; reserve excess for another use). Transfer 1⁄2 cup of puree to small bowl and sprinkle gelatin over top; let stand at least 5 minutes to soften and stir. Heat remaining 2 cups puree in small saucepan over medium heat until it begins to bubble, 4 to 6 minutes. Off heat, stir in gelatin mixture until dissolved. Transfer to medium bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until well chilled, about 2 hours.  
2. Meanwhile, chop remaining strawberries into rough 1⁄4-inch pieces. Toss strawberries, remaining raspberries, and 2 tablespoons sugar together in medium bowl. Set aside for 1 hour.  
3. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip cream, sour cream, vanilla, and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar on low speed until bubbles form, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to medium and whip until whisk leaves trail, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to high; whip until mixture has nearly doubled in volume and holds stiff peaks, about 30 seconds. Transfer 1⁄3 cup of whipped cream mixture to small bowl; set aside.  
4. Remove berry puree from refrigerator and whisk until smooth. With mixer on medium speed, slowly add two-thirds of puree to whipped cream mixture; mix until incorporated, about 15 seconds. Using spatula, gently fold in remaining puree, leaving streaks of puree.  
5. Transfer uncooked berries to fine-mesh strainer; shake gently to remove any excess juice. Divide two-thirds of berries evenly among six tall parfait or sundae glasses. Divide creamy berry mixture evenly among glasses, followed by remaining uncooked berries. Top each glass with reserved plain whipped cream mixture. Sprinkle with crushed crackers and garnish with mint sprigs, if using. Serve immediately.

INDIVIDUAL PAVLOVAS WITH TROPICAL FRUIT  
#quantity  
SERVES 6  
#ingredients  
Be mindful that the fruit is the garnish here, so it’s worth taking the time to cut it into tidy pieces. Sour cream gives the whipped cream a slight tang; omit it if you prefer simple whipped cream. Avoid making pavlovas on humid days or the meringue shells will turn out sticky.  
MERINGUES AND FRUIT  
4 large egg whites, room temperature  
3⁄4 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1⁄4 teaspoon cream of tartar  
1 cup (7 ounces) plus 1 tablespoon sugar  
1 mango, peeled, pitted, and cut into 1⁄4-inch pieces  
2 kiwis, peeled, quartered, and sliced thin  
1-1⁄2 cups pineapple, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces  
TOPPING  
1 cup heavy cream, chilled  
1⁄2 cup sour cream, chilled  
1 tablespoon sugar  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE MERINGUES: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Line baking sheet with parchment paper.  
2. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip egg whites, vanilla, and cream of tartar on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and whip whites to soft, billowy mounds, about 1 minute. Gradually add 1 cup sugar and whip until glossy, stiff peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes.  
3. Scoop six 1⁄2-cup mounds of meringue onto prepared sheet, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Gently make small, bowllike indentation in each meringue using back of spoon. Bake until meringues have smooth, dry, and firm exteriors, about 1-1⁄2 hours. Turn oven off and leave meringues in oven until completely dry and hard, about 2 hours. (Meringue shells can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.)  
4. FOR THE FRUIT: Gently toss mango, kiwis, and pineapple with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar in large bowl. Let sit at room temperature until sugar has dissolved and fruit is juicy, about 30 minutes.  
5. FOR THE TOPPING: Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip heavy cream, sour cream, sugar, and vanilla on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until soft peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. (Whipped cream can be refrigerated in fine-mesh strainer set over small bowl and covered with plastic wrap for up to 8 hours.)  
5. To assemble, place meringue shells on individual plates and spoon about 1⁄3 cup whipped cream into each shell. Top with about 1⁄2 cup fruit (some fruit and juice will fall onto plate). Serve immediately.  
INDIVIDUAL PAVLOVAS WITH MIXED BERRIES  
Substitute 7-1⁄2 ounces each raspberries and blueberries and 5 ounces blackberries for mango, kiwi, and pineapple.  
INDIVIDUAL PAVLOVAS WITH STRAWBERRIES, BLUEBERRIES, AND PEACHES  
If your peaches are firm, you should be able to peel them with a vegetable peeler. If they are too soft and ripe to withstand the pressure of a peeler, you’ll need to blanch them in a pot of simmering water for 15 seconds and then shock them in a bowl of ice water before peeling.

If your peaches are firm, you should be able to peel them with a vegetable peeler. If they are too soft and ripe to withstand the pressure of a peeler, you’ll need to blanch them in a pot of simmering water for 15 seconds and then shock them in a bowl of ice water before peeling. Do not prepare the biscuit dough any sooner than the recipe indicates or the biscuits may not rise properly. If desired, plain low-fat or nonfat yogurt can be substituted for the whole-milk yogurt, but the biscuits will be a little less rich. If the dough does not come together, you can add up to 1 tablespoon more yogurt. This recipe can be doubled; use a 13 by 9-inch baking dish and increase the baking times in steps 1 and 3 by about 5 minutes. Serve with vanilla ice cream or WHIPPED CREAM.  
FILLING

2 teaspoons cornstarch  
1⁄8 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter  
2-1⁄2 pounds apples, peeled, cored, and cut into 1⁄2-inch-thick wedges  
1 large egg white, lightly beaten  
2 teaspoons sugar  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CRUST: Pulse flour, sugar, and salt in food processor until combined, about 4 pulses. Add shortening and pulse until mixture resembles coarse sand, about 10 pulses. Sprinkle butter pieces over top and pulse until mixture is pale yellow and resembles coarse crumbs, with butter bits no larger than small peas, about 10 pulses. Transfer mixture to medium bowl.  
2. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons ice water over mixture. With rubber spatula, use folding motion to mix, pressing down on dough until dough is slightly tacky and sticks together, adding up to 1 tablespoon more ice water if dough does not come together. Flatten dough into 4-inch disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. Let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes before rolling.  
3. FOR THE FILLING: Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 500 degrees. Whisk cider, maple syrup, lemon juice, cornstarch, and cinnamon, if using, together in bowl until smooth. Melt butter in 12-inch ovensafe skillet over medium-high heat. Add apples and cook, stirring 2 or 3 times, until apples begin to caramelize, about 5 minutes. (Do not fully cook apples.) Off heat, add cider mixture and gently stir until apples are well coated. Set aside to cool slightly.  
4. TO ASSEMBLE AND BAKE: Roll dough out on lightly floured counter to 11-inch round. Roll dough loosely around rolling pin and unroll over apple filling. Brush dough with egg white and sprinkle with sugar. With sharp knife, gently cut dough into 6 pieces by making one vertical cut followed by 2 evenly spaced horizontal cuts (perpendicular to first cut). Bake until apples are tender and crust is deep golden brown, about 20 minutes, rotating skillet halfway through baking. Let cool about 15 minutes; serve warm.  
SCORING PANDOWDY CRUST  
With a sharp knife, gently cut the dough into 6 pieces by making 1 vertical cut followed by 2 evenly spaced horizontal cuts (perpendicular to the first cut). This encourages a crisp crust and allows the juices from the apples to bubble up and caramelize.

SKILLET APPLE BROWN BETTY  
#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
If your apples are especially tart, omit the lemon juice. If, on the other hand, your apples are exceptionally sweet, use the full amount. When preparing the apples, put each variety into separate bowls since they’re added to the skillet at different times. Serve with vanilla ice cream. Leftovers can be refrigerated; topped with vanilla yogurt, they make an excellent breakfast.  
BREAD CRUMBS  
4 slices hearty white sandwich bread, torn into quarters  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces  
2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar

1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
1⁄2 teaspoon grated lemon zest  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
2 large eggs, room temperature  
20 ounces (4 cups) blueberries  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE STREUSEL: Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, combine flour, brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, and salt on low speed until well combined and no large brown sugar lumps remain, about 45 seconds. Add butter; beat on low speed until mixture resembles wet sand and no large butter pieces remain, about 2-1⁄2 minutes. Transfer to bowl; set aside.  
2. FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease 9-inch round cake pan, line bottom with parchment paper, grease parchment, then flour pan.  
3. Whisk flour and baking powder together in bowl; set aside. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter, sugar, salt, and zest on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes, scraping down bowl as necessary. Beat in vanilla until combined, about 30 seconds. With mixer on medium speed, add eggs 1 at a time; beat until partially incorporated, scrape down bowl, and continue to beat until fully incorporated (mixture will appear broken). With mixer on low speed, gradually add flour mixture; beat until flour is almost fully incorporated, about 20 seconds. Stir batter with rubber spatula, scraping bowl, until no flour pockets remain and batter is homogeneous; batter will be very heavy and thick. Gently fold in blueberries until evenly distributed.  
4. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Spread batter evenly to pan edges and smooth surface. Squeeze portion of streusel in hand to form large cohesive clump; break up clump with fingers and sprinkle streusel evenly over batter. Repeat with remaining streusel. Bake until cake is deep golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 55 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking. Transfer pan to wire rack and let cool, 15 to 20 minutes (cake will fall slightly as it cools).  
5. Run paring knife around edges to loosen. Invert cake, then peel off and discard parchment. Invert cake onto serving platter. Let cool at least 1 hour. Cut into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature. (Buckle can be stored at room temperature, wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 2 days.)

INDIVIDUAL FRESH BERRY GRATINS WITH ZABAGLIONE  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
When making the zabaglione, make sure to cook the egg mixture in a glass bowl over water that is barely simmering; glass conducts heat more evenly and gently than metal. If the heat is too high, the yolks around the edges of the bowl will start to scramble. Constant whisking is required. Do not use frozen berries for this recipe. You will need four shallow 6-inch gratin dishes, but a broiler-safe pie plate or gratin dish can be used instead. To prevent scorching, pay close attention to the gratins when broiling.  
BERRY MIXTURE  
15 ounces mixed berries (raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries; strawberries hulled and halved lengthwise if small, quartered if large) (3 cups)  
2 teaspoons granulated sugar  
Pinch salt  
ZABAGLIONE  
3 large egg yolks  
3 tablespoons granulated sugar  
3 tablespoons dry white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc  
2 teaspoons light brown sugar  
3 tablespoons heavy cream, chilled  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE BERRY MIXTURE: Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Toss berries, sugar, and salt together in bowl. Divide berry mixture evenly among 4 shallow 6-ounce gratin dishes set on prepared baking sheet; set aside.  
2. FOR THE ZABAGLIONE: Whisk egg yolks, 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon granulated sugar, and wine together in medium bowl until sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute. Set bowl over saucepan of barely simmering water and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture is frothy. Continue to cook, whisking constantly, until mixture is slightly thickened, creamy, and glossy, 5 to 10 minutes (mixture will form loose mounds when dripped from whisk). Remove bowl from saucepan and whisk constantly for 30 seconds to cool slightly. Transfer bowl to refrigerator and chill until egg mixture is completely cool, about 10 minutes.  
3. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack 6 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Combine brown sugar and remaining 2 teaspoons granulated sugar in bowl.  
4. Whisk heavy cream in large bowl until it holds soft peaks, 30 to 90 seconds. Using rubber spatula, gently fold whipped cream into cooled egg mixture. Spoon zabaglione over berries and sprinkle sugar mixture evenly on top; let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes, until sugar dissolves.  
5. Broil gratins until sugar is bubbly and caramelized, 1 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately.  
INDIVIDUAL FRESH BERRY GRATINS WITH HONEY-LAVENDER ZABAGLIONE  
Heat 2 teaspoons dried lavender and 1⁄4 cup dry white wine in small saucepan over medium heat until barely simmering; remove from heat and let stand 10 minutes. Strain wine through fine-mesh strainer and discard lavender (you should have 3 tablespoons wine). Substitute lavender-infused wine for white wine and 2 teaspoons honey for 1 teaspoon granulated sugar in step 2.  
INDIVIDUAL FRESH BERRY GRATINS WITH LEMON ZABAGLIONE  
Replace 1 tablespoon wine with equal amount lemon juice and add 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest to egg yolk mixture in step 2.

CRÊPES WITH SUGAR AND LEMON  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
Crêpes will give off steam as they cook, but if at any point the skillet begins to smoke, remove it from the heat immediately and turn down the heat. Stacking the crêpes on a wire rack allows excess steam to escape so they won’t stick together. To allow for practice, the recipe yields 10 crêpes; only eight are needed for the filling.  
1⁄2 teaspoon vegetable oil  
1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour  
3 tablespoons sugar  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1-1⁄2 cups whole milk  
3 large eggs  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled  
Lemon wedges  
#instructions  
1. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over low heat for at least 10 minutes.  
2. While skillet is heating, whisk flour, 1 teaspoon sugar, and salt together in medium bowl. In separate bowl, whisk together milk and eggs. Add half of milk mixture to dry ingredients and whisk until smooth. Add butter and whisk until incorporated. Whisk in remaining milk mixture until smooth.  
3. Wipe out skillet with paper towel, leaving thin film of oil on bottom and sides of pan. Increase heat to medium and let skillet heat for 1 minute. After 1 minute, test heat of skillet by placing 1 teaspoon batter in center and cook for 20 seconds. If mini crêpe is golden brown on bottom, skillet is properly heated; if it is too light or too dark, adjust heat accordingly and retest.  
4. Pour 1⁄4 cup batter into far side of pan and tilt and shake gently until batter evenly covers bottom of pan. Cook crêpe without moving until top surface is dry and edges are starting to brown, loosening crêpe from side of pan with rubber spatula, about 25 seconds. Gently slide spatula underneath edge of crêpe, grasp edge with fingertips, and flip crêpe. Cook until second side is lightly spotted, about 20 seconds. Transfer cooked crêpe to wire rack, inverting so spotted side is facing up. Return pan to heat and heat for 10 seconds before repeating with remaining batter. As crêpes are done, stack on wire rack.  
5. Transfer stack of crêpes to large plate and invert second plate over crêpes. Microwave until crêpes are warm, 30 to 45 seconds (45 to 60 seconds if crêpes have cooled completely). Remove top plate and wipe dry with paper towel. Sprinkle half of top crêpe with 1 teaspoon sugar. Fold unsugared bottom half over sugared half, then fold into quarters. Transfer sugared crêpe to second plate. Continue with remaining crêpes. Serve immediately, passing lemon wedges separately.  
CRÊPES WITH BANANAS AND NUTELLA  
Omit 8 teaspoons sprinkling sugar and lemon wedges. Spread 2 teaspoons Nutella over half of each crêpe followed by eight to ten 1⁄4-inch-thick banana slices. Fold crêpes into quarters. Serve immediately.  
CRÊPES WITH HONEY AND TOASTED ALMONDS  
Omit 8 teaspoons sprinkling sugar and lemon wedges. Drizzle 1 teaspoon honey over half of each crêpe and sprinkle with 2 teaspoons finely chopped toasted sliced almonds and pinch salt. Fold crêpes into quarters. Serve immediately.  
CRÊPES WITH CHOCOLATE AND ORANGE  
Omit 8 teaspoons sprinkling sugar and lemon wedges. Using fingertips, rub 1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest into 1⁄4 cup sugar. Stir in 2 ounces finely grated bittersweet chocolate. Sprinkle 1-1⁄2 tablespoons chocolate-orange mixture over half of each crêpe. Fold crêpes into quarters. Serve immediately.  
CRÊPES WITH DULCE DE LECHE AND TOASTED PECANS  
Dulce de leche is a milk-based caramel sauce and spread. Look for it in the international foods aisle of supermarkets or in Latin markets.  
Omit 8 teaspoons sprinkling sugar and lemon wedges. Drizzle 1 teaspoon dulce de leche over half of each crêpe and sprinkle with 2 teaspoons finely chopped toasted pecans and small pinch salt. Fold crêpe into quarters. Serve immediately.

CRÊPES SUZETTE  
#quantity  
SERVES 6  
#ingredients  
To allow for practice, the recipe yields about 16 crêpes; only 12 are needed for the dish. We prefer crêpes made with whole milk, but skim milk or 1 percent or 2 percent low-fat milk can also be used. Before flambéing, be sure to roll up long shirtsleeves, tie back long hair, and turn off the exhaust fan and any lit burners.  
CRÊPES  
1-1⁄2 cups whole milk  
1-1⁄2 cups (7-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
3 large eggs  
1⁄2 cup water  
5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus extra for pan  
3 tablespoons sugar  
2 tablespoons cognac  
1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
ORANGE SAUCE  
1⁄4 cup cognac  
1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest plus 1-1⁄4 cups juice (3 oranges)  
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 6 pieces  
1⁄4 cup sugar  
2 tablespoons orange liqueur, such as triple sec  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CRÊPES: Process all ingredients in blender until smooth, about 10 seconds. Transfer to bowl.  
2. Brush bottom and sides of 10-inch nonstick skillet lightly with melted butter and heat skillet over medium heat. Pour in scant 1⁄4 cup batter in slow, steady stream, twirling skillet slowly until bottom is evenly covered. Cook crêpe until it starts to lose its opaqueness and turns spotty light golden brown on bottom, 30 seconds to 1 minute, loosening edge with rubber spatula. Gently slide spatula underneath edge of crêpe, grasp edge with fingertips, and flip crêpe. Cook until dry on second side, about 20 seconds.  
3. Transfer cooked crêpe to wire rack, inverting so spotted side is facing up. Return pan to heat, brush pan lightly with butter and heat for 10 seconds before repeating with remaining batter. As crêpes are done, stack on wire rack. (Cooked crêpes can be refrigerated, wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 3 days; bring them to room temperature before proceeding with recipe.)  
4. FOR THE ORANGE SAUCE: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat broiler. Heat 3 tablespoons cognac in 12-inch broiler-safe skillet over medium heat just until warmed through, about 5 seconds. Off heat, wave lit match over pan until cognac ignites, then shake pan to distribute flames.  
5. When flames subside, add 1 cup orange juice, butter, and 3 tablespoons sugar and simmer over high heat, stirring occasionally, until many large bubbles appear and mixture reduces to thick syrup, 6 to 8 minutes (you should have just over 1⁄2 cup sauce). Transfer sauce to small bowl; do not wash skillet. Stir remaining 1⁄4 cup orange juice, orange zest, orange liqueur, and remaining 1 tablespoon cognac into sauce; cover to keep warm.  
6. To assemble, fold each crêpe in half, then fold into quarters. Arrange 9 folded crêpes around edge of now-empty skillet, with rounded edges facing inward, overlapping as necessary to fit. Arrange remaining 2 crêpes in center of pan. Sprinkle crêpes evenly with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Broil until sugar caramelizes and crêpes turn spotty brown, about 5 minutes. (Watch crêpes constantly to prevent scorching; turn pan as necessary.) Carefully remove pan from oven and pour half of sauce over crêpes, leaving some areas uncovered. Transfer crêpes to individual plates and serve immediately, passing extra sauce separately.

SIMPLE APPLESAUCE  
#quantity  
MAKES ABOUT 3-1⁄2 CUPS  
#ingredients  
If you do not own a food mill or prefer applesauce with a coarse texture, peel the apples before coring and cutting them and, after cooking, mash them against the side of the pot with a wooden spoon or against the bottom of the pot with a potato masher. Applesauce made with out-of-season apples may be somewhat drier than applesauce made with in-season apples, so you may need to add more water in step 2 to adjust the texture. This recipe doubles easily; increase the cooking time by 10 to 15 minutes.  
4 pounds apples, preferably Jonagold, Jonathan, Pink Lady, or Macoun, cored, and cut into rough 1-1⁄2-inch pieces  
1 cup water, plus extra as needed  
1⁄4 cup sugar, plus extra to taste  
Pinch salt  
#instructions  
1. Toss apples, water, sugar, and salt in Dutch oven. Cover pot and cook apples over medium-high heat until they begin to break down, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to break up large chunks.  
2. Process cooked apples through food mill. Season with sugar to taste or add water as needed to adjust consistency. Serve warm, at room temperature, or chilled. (Applesauce can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.)  
CINNAMON APPLESAUCE  
Add 2 cinnamon sticks to Dutch oven with apples. Cook as directed, removing cinnamon sticks before processing. Alternatively, stir 1⁄4 teaspoon cinnamon into finished applesauce.  
CRANBERRY APPLESAUCE  
Add 4 ounces fresh or frozen cranberries to Dutch oven with apples. Cook and process as directed.  
GINGER APPLESAUCE  
Add three 1⁄2-inch slices ginger, peeled and smashed, to Dutch oven with apples. Cook as directed, removing ginger before processing.

6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened  
1⁄3 cup dried cranberries, chopped coarse  
1⁄3 cup pecans, toasted and chopped coarse  
1⁄4 cup packed (1-3⁄4 ounces) brown sugar  
3 tablespoons old-fashioned rolled oats  
1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest  
1⁄2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
Pinch salt  
1⁄3 cup maple syrup  
1⁄3 cup plus 2 tablespoons apple cider  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Peel, core, and cut 1 apple into 1⁄4-inch dice. Combine diced apple, 5 tablespoons butter, cranberries, pecans, sugar, oats, zest, cinnamon, and salt in bowl; set aside.  
2. Shave thin slice off bottom (blossom end) of remaining 6 apples to allow them to sit flat. Cut top 1⁄2 inch off stem end of apples and reserve. Peel apples and use melon baller or small measuring spoon to remove 1-1⁄2-inch-diameter core, being careful not to cut through bottom of apples.  
3. Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in 12-inch ovensafe nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add apples, stem side down, and cook until cut surface is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip apples, reduce heat to low, and spoon filling inside, mounding excess filling over cavities; top with reserved apple caps. Add maple syrup and 1⁄3 cup cider to skillet. Transfer skillet to oven and bake until skewer inserted into apples meets little resistance, 35 to 40 minutes, basting every 10 minutes with maple syrup mixture in pan.  
4. Transfer apples to serving platter. Stir up to 2 tablespoons of remaining cider into sauce in skillet to adjust consistency. Pour sauce over apples and serve.

KEY STEPS TO BETTER BAKED APPLES  
#instructions  
1. Slicing off tops allows for generous room for filling and removing entire peel for base prevents blowouts and keeps flesh firm.  
2. Sautéing apples in butter before baking contributes rich, caramelized flavor.  
3. Capping apples with sliced-off tops shields filling from burning in oven.

#ingredients  
A serving of profiteroles consists of three baked puffs filled with ice cream and topped with sauce. The Pâte à Choux recipe makes 24 puffs, technically enough to serve eight, but inevitably a few bake up too awkwardly shaped to serve to guests. For profiteroles, the smooth, dense texture and rich flavor of a high-quality custard-style ice cream is preferable to the light, fluffy texture and milky flavor of Philadelphia-style ice cream, which is made without eggs. If you’re serving several guests, prescooping the ice cream makes serving quick and neat, but if you’re assembling only a couple servings or your freezer lacks space, you can skip the prescooping step.  
1 recipe PÂTE À CHOUX  
FILLING AND GLAZE  
1 quart vanilla or coffee custard-style ice cream  
3⁄4 cup heavy cream  
3 tablespoons light corn syrup  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 3 pieces  
Pinch salt  
6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped fine  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE PASTRY: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Spray baking sheet with vegetable oil spray and line with parchment paper.  
2. Fit pastry bag with 1⁄2-inch plain tip and fill with warm pâte à choux. Pipe pâte à choux into 1-1⁄2-inch mounds on prepared sheet, spacing them about 1 inch apart (you should have about 24 mounds). Use back of teaspoon dipped in cold water to even out shape and smooth surface of mounds.  
3. Bake pastries for 15 minutes (do not open oven door), then reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees and continue to bake until golden brown and fairly firm (pastries should not be soft and squishy), 8 to 10 minutes longer.  
4. Remove baking sheet from oven and cut 3⁄4-inch slit into side of each pastry with paring knife to release steam. Return pastries to oven, turn off oven, and prop oven door open with handle of wooden spoon. Dry pastries in turned-off oven until center is just moist (not wet) and surface is crisp, about 45 minutes. Transfer pastries to wire rack to cool. (Cooled pastries can be stored at room temperature for up to 24 hours or frozen in zipper-lock bag for up to 1 month. Re-crisp room-temperature puffs in 300-degree oven for 5 to 8 minutes, or frozen puffs for 8 to 10 minutes.)  
5. FOR THE FILLING AND GLAZE: Line clean baking sheet with parchment and freeze until cold, about 20 minutes. Place 2-inch scoops of ice cream onto chilled baking sheet and freeze until firm, then cover with plastic wrap; keep frozen until ready to serve.  
6. Bring heavy cream, corn syrup, butter, and salt to boil in small saucepan. Off heat, stir in chocolate. Cover saucepan and let stand until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Whisk gently until combined. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.)

BAKLAVA  
#quantity  
MAKES 32 TO 40 PIECES  
#ingredients  
Phyllo dough is also available in larger 18 by 14-inch sheets; if using, cut them in half to make 14 by 9-inch sheets. Do not thaw the phyllo in the microwave; let it sit in the refrigerator overnight or on the counter for 4 to 5 hours. A straight-sided traditional (not nonstick) metal baking pan works best for making baklava. If you don’t have this type of pan, a glass baking dish will work. When assembling, use the nicest, most intact phyllo sheets for the bottom and top layers; use sheets with tears or ones that are smaller than the size of the pan in the middle layers, where their imperfections will go unnoticed. If, after assembly, you have leftover clarified butter, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator; it can be used for sautéing.  
SUGAR SYRUP  
1-1⁄4 cups (8-3⁄4 ounces) sugar  
3⁄4 cup water  
1⁄3 cup honey  
3 (2-inch) strips lemon zest plus 1 tablespoon juice  
1 cinnamon stick  
5 whole cloves  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
NUT FILLING  
1-3⁄4 cups (77⁄8 ounces) slivered almonds  
1 cup walnuts  
2 tablespoons sugar  
1-1⁄4 teaspoons ground cinnamon  
1⁄4 teaspoon ground cloves  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
PASTRY AND BUTTER  
24 tablespoons unsalted butter (3 sticks), cut into 1-inch pieces  
1 pound (14 by 9-inch) phyllo, thawed  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE SUGAR SYRUP: Bring all ingredients to boil in small saucepan, stirring occasionally to ensure that sugar dissolves. Transfer syrup to 2-cup liquid measuring cup and set aside to cool while making and baking baklava; when syrup is cool, remove spices and lemon zest. (Cooled syrup can be refrigerated for up to 4 days.)  
2. FOR THE NUT FILLING: Pulse almonds in food processor until very finely chopped, about 20 pulses; transfer to medium bowl. Pulse walnuts in food processor until very finely chopped, about 15 pulses; transfer to bowl with almonds and toss to combine. Measure out 1 tablespoon nuts and set aside for garnish. Add sugar, cinnamon, cloves, and salt to nut mixture and toss well to combine.  
3. TO ASSEMBLE AND BAKE: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Melt butter slowly in small saucepan over medium-low heat until milk solids have separated from butterfat and collected on bottom of saucepan, about 10 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat, let butter settle for 10 minutes, then carefully skim foam from surface with spoon.  
4. When all of foam has been removed, slowly pour clear butterfat into bowl, leaving all milk solids behind in the saucepan (you should have about 1 cup clarified butter).  
5. Grease 13 by 9-inch baking pan with clarified butter. Place 1 sheet of phyllo in bottom of prepared pan and brush with clarified butter until completely coated. Layer 7 sheets of phyllo into pan, brushing each sheet with butter. Sprinkle 1 cup nut filling evenly over phyllo.  
6. Layer 6 sheets of phyllo into pan, brushing each layer with butter, then sprinkle with 1 cup nut filling. Repeat with 6 sheets of phyllo, butter, and remaining 1 cup nut filling.  
7. Layer remaining 8 to 10 sheets of phyllo into pan, brushing each layer, except final layer, with butter. Working from center outward, use palms of hands to compress layers and press out any air pockets. Spoon 4 tablespoons of butter on top layer and brush to cover surface.  
8. Using serrated knife with pointed tip, cut baklava into diamonds. Bake baklava until golden and crisp, about 1-1⁄2 hours, rotating pan halfway through baking.  
9. Immediately pour all but 2 tablespoons of cooled syrup over cut lines (syrup will sizzle when it hits hot pan). Drizzle remaining 2 tablespoons syrup over surface. Garnish center of each piece with pinch of reserved ground nuts. Let baklava cool completely in pan, about 3 hours, then cover with aluminum foil and let sit at room temperature for about 8 hours before serving.  
PISTACHIO BAKLAVA WITH CARDAMOM AND ROSE WATER  
Omit honey, lemon zest, and cinnamon in sugar syrup and increase sugar to 1-3⁄4 cups. Substitute 10 whole peppercorns for cloves and stir in 1 tablespoon rose water after discarding peppercorns. Substitute 2-3⁄4 cups shelled pistachios for almonds and walnuts and 1 teaspoon ground cardamom for cinnamon and cloves in nut filling.

QUICKER APPLE STRUDEL  
#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
Do not thaw the phyllo dough in the microwave; let it sit in the refrigerator overnight or on the counter for 4 to 5 hours. If the phyllo sheets have small cuts or tears in the same location, flip the alternating sheets of phyllo when assembling the strudel in step 4, so that the cuts will not line up and cause a weak spot in the crust. To make fresh bread crumbs, pulse 1 slice white sandwich bread (with crust) in a food processor to fine crumbs, about 6 pulses; you will have 1 cup fresh bread crumbs. Serve the strudel warm with TANGY WHIPPED CREAM or WHIPPED CREAM; if you choose to make the tangy whipped cream, make it before starting the strudel because it must stand at room temperature for about 1-1⁄2 hours before serving.  
1⁄2 cup golden raisins  
2 tablespoons Calvados or apple cider  
1⁄4 cup fresh white bread crumbs  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled  
1 pound Golden Delicious apples, peeled, cored, and sliced 1⁄4 inch thick  
1 McIntosh apple, peeled, cored, and sliced 1⁄4 inch thick  
1⁄3 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped fine (optional)  
1⁄4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (2-2⁄3 ounces) granulated sugar  
1 teaspoon lemon juice  
1⁄4 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
10 (14 by 9-inch) sheets phyllo, thawed  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons confectioners’ sugar  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 475 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine raisins and Calvados in small bowl, cover, and microwave until simmering, about 1 minute. Let sit, covered, until needed.  
2. Toast bread crumbs with 1 tablespoon melted butter in 8-inch skillet over medium heat, stirring often, until golden brown, about 2 minutes; transfer to large bowl.  
3. Drain raisins, discarding liquid. Add raisins, apples, walnuts, if using, 1⁄4 cup granulated sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, and salt to bowl with bread crumbs and toss to combine.  
4. Place large sheet of parchment horizontally on work surface. Lay 1 sheet of phyllo on left side of sheet of parchment, then brush with melted butter and sprinkle with 1⁄2 teaspoon sugar. Place another sheet of phyllo on right side of parchment, overlapping sheets by 1 inch, then brush with butter and sprinkle with 1⁄2 teaspoon sugar. Repeat with remaining 8 sheets of phyllo, brushing each layer with butter and sprinkling with sugar. Mound filling along bottom edge of phyllo, leaving 2-1⁄2-inch border on bottom and 2-inch border on sides. Fold dough on sides over apples. Fold dough on bottom over apples and continue to roll dough around filling to form strudel.  
5. Gently transfer strudel, seam side down, to prepared baking sheet; brush with remaining butter and sprinkle with remaining 1 teaspoon sugar. Cut four 1-1⁄2-inch vents on diagonal across top of strudel and bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. Transfer strudel with baking sheet to wire rack and let cool until warm, about 40 minutes.

DANISH DOUGH  
#quantity  
MAKES ENOUGH FOR 1 LARGE BRAID OR 9 INDIVIDUAL DANISH  
#ingredients  
If the dough becomes too warm and sticky to work with, cover it with plastic wrap and let it chill in the refrigerator until firm. When rolling the dough out, sprinkle extra flour over the counter and the rolling pin as needed to keep the dough from sticking. For more information on making turns in the dough, see “MAKING PUFF PASTRY DOUGH”.  
DOUGH  
1⁄3 cup whole milk, heated to 110 degrees  
1 large egg  
1-1⁄2 cups (7-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄4 cup (1-3⁄4 ounces) sugar  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast  
3⁄4 teaspoon salt  
BUTTER SQUARE  
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 3 equal pieces and chilled  
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE DOUGH: Mix milk and egg together in liquid measuring cup. Using stand mixer fitted with dough hook, combine 1-1⁄4 cups flour, sugar, yeast, and salt on low speed. Slowly add milk mixture and mix until dough comes together, about 2 minutes.  
2. Increase speed to medium-low and knead dough until it forms sticky ball and becomes elastic, about 8 minutes. If, after 5 minutes, dough appears overly sticky and doesn’t come together into ball, add remaining 1⁄4 cup flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Scrape dough into large lightly greased bowl, cover with greased plastic wrap, and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.  
3. FOR THE BUTTER SQUARE: Lay 3 butter pieces side by side on sheet of parchment paper. Sprinkle flour over butter and cover with second sheet of parchment. Gently pound butter with rolling pin until butter is softened and flour is fully incorporated, then roll it into 5-inch square. Wrap butter square in plastic and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.  
4. Roll chilled dough onto 9-inch square on lightly floured counter. Place chilled butter square diagonally in center of dough. Fold corners of dough up over butter square so that corners meet in middle and pinch dough seams to seal.  
5. Using rolling pin, gently tap dough, starting from center and working outward, until square becomes larger and butter begins to soften. Gently roll dough into 11-inch square, dusting with extra flour as needed to prevent sticking. Fold dough into thirds like business letter, then fold rectangle in thirds to form square. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and let rest in refrigerator for 2 hours.  
6. Repeat step 5 and let dough rest in refrigerator for 2 more hours before using.

CROISSANTS  
#quantity  
MAKES 22  
#ingredients  
These croissants take at least 10 hours to make from start to finish, but the process can be spread over 2 days. European-style cultured butters have a higher butterfat content, which makes it easier to fold them into the dough. (Our favorite is from Plugrá.) Any brand of all-purpose flour will produce acceptable croissants, but we recommend using King Arthur All-Purpose Flour, which has a slightly higher protein content. Do not attempt to make these croissants in a room that is warmer than 80 degrees. If at any time during rolling the dough retracts, dust it lightly with flour, fold it loosely, cover it, and return it to the freezer to rest for 10 to 15 minutes.  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter plus 24 tablespoons (3 sticks) unsalted European-style butter, very cold  
1-3⁄4 cups whole milk  
4 teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast  
4-1⁄4 cups (21-1⁄4 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄4 cup (1-3⁄4 ounces) sugar  
Salt  
1 large egg  
1 teaspoon cold water  
#instructions  
1. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in medium saucepan over low heat. Remove from heat and immediately stir in milk (temperature should be lower than 90 degrees). Whisk in yeast; transfer milk mixture to bowl of stand mixer. Add flour, sugar, and 2 teaspoons salt. Using dough hook, knead on low speed until cohesive dough forms, 2 to 3 minutes. Increase speed to medium-low and knead for 1 minute. Remove bowl from mixer, remove dough hook, and cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.  
2. Transfer dough to parchment paper–lined baking sheet and shape into 10 by 7-inch rectangle about 1 inch thick. Wrap tightly with plastic and refrigerate for 2 hours.  
3. FOR THE BUTTER BLOCK: While dough chills, fold 24-inch length of parchment in half to create 12-inch rectangle. Fold over 3 open sides of rectangle to form 8-inch square with enclosed sides. Crease folds firmly. Place 24 tablespoons cold butter directly on counter and beat with rolling pin for about 60 seconds until butter is just pliable, but not warm, folding butter in on itself using bench scraper. Beat into rough 6-inch square. Unfold parchment envelope. Using bench scraper, transfer butter to center of parchment square, refolding at creases to enclose. Turn packet over so that flaps are underneath and gently roll butter packet until butter fills parchment square, taking care to achieve even thickness. Refrigerate at least 45 minutes.  
4. TO LAMINATE THE DOUGH: Transfer dough to freezer. After 30 minutes, transfer dough to lightly floured counter and roll into 17 by 8-inch rectangle with long side of rectangle parallel to edge of counter. Unwrap butter and place in center of dough so that butter and dough are flush at top and bottom. Fold 2 sides of dough over butter square so they meet in center. Press seam together with fingertips. With rolling pin, press firmly on each open end of packet. Roll out dough, perpendicular to edge of counter, to rectangle 24 inches long and 8 inches wide. Bring bottom third of dough up, then fold upper third over it, folding like business letter into 8-inch square. Turn dough 90 degrees counterclockwise. Roll out dough again, perpendicular to edge of counter, into 24 by 8-inch rectangle and fold into thirds. Place dough on baking sheet, wrap tightly with plastic, and return to freezer for 30 minutes.  
5. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter so that top flap of dough is facing right. Roll once more, perpendicular to edge of counter, into 24 by 8-inch rectangle and fold into thirds. Place dough on baking sheet, wrap tightly with plastic, and refrigerate for 2 hours.  
6. Transfer dough to freezer. After 30 minutes, transfer to lightly floured counter and roll into 18 by 16-inch rectangle with long side of rectangle parallel to edge of counter. Fold upper half of dough over lower half. Using ruler, mark dough at 3-inch intervals along bottom edge with bench scraper (you should have 5 marks). Move ruler to top of dough, measure in 1-1⁄2 inches from left, then use this mark to measure out 3-inch intervals (you should have 6 marks). Starting at lower left corner, use pizza wheel or knife to cut dough into triangles from mark to mark. You will have 12 single triangles and 5 double triangles; discard scraps. Unfold double triangles and cut into 10 single triangles (making 22 equal-size triangles in total). If dough begins to soften, return to freezer for 10 minutes.  
7. TO SHAPE THE CROISSANTS: Position 1 triangle on counter. (Keep remaining triangles covered with plastic while shaping.) Cut 1⁄2 inch slit in center of short end of triangle. Grasp triangle by 2 corners on either side of slit, and stretch gently, then grasp bottom point and stretch. Place triangle on counter so point is facing toward you. Fold both sides of slit down. Positioning palms on folds, roll partway toward point. Gently grasp point again and stretch. To finish, continue to roll, tucking point underneath. Curve ends gently toward one another to create crescent shape. Repeat with remaining triangles.  
8. Place 12 croissants on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, leaving at least 2-1⁄2 inches between croissants, 6 croissants per sheet. Lightly wrap baking sheets with plastic, leaving room for croissants to expand. Let stand at room temperature until nearly doubled in size, 2-1⁄2 to 3 hours. (Shaped croissants can be refrigerated on trays for up to 18 hours. Remove from refrigerator to rise and add at least 30 minutes to rising time.)  
9. After croissants have been rising for 2 hours, adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 425 degrees. In small bowl, whisk together egg, water, and pinch of salt. Brush croissants with egg wash using pastry brush. Place croissants in oven and reduce temperature to 400 degrees. Bake for 12 minutes, then switch and rotate baking sheets. Continue to bake until deep golden brown, 8 to 12 minutes longer. Transfer croissants to wire rack and allow to cool until just warm, about 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.  
TO MAKE AHEAD: After shaping, place croissants 1 inch apart on parchment-lined baking sheet. Wrap with plastic wrap and freeze until solid, about 2 hours. Transfer frozen croissants from baking sheet to zipper-lock bag and return to freezer for up to 2 months. Bake frozen croissants as directed from step 8, increasing rising time by 1 to 2 hours.  
MAKING A BUTTER BLOCK FOR CROISSANTS  
#instructions  
1. Fold 24-inch length of parchment in half to create 12-inch rectangle. Fold over 3 open sides of rectangle to form 8-inch square.  
2. Using rolling pin, beat butter until it is just pliable, then fold butter in on itself using bench scraper. Beat butter into rough 6-inch square.  
3. Unfold parchment envelope and, using bench scraper, transfer butter to parchment, refolding at creases to enclose.  
4. Turn packet over, and gently roll butter with rolling pin so butter block fills parchment square, taking care to achieve even thickness. Refrigerate.  
LAMINATING THE DOUGH FOR CROISSANTS  
#instructions  
1. Roll chilled dough into 17 by 8-inch rectangle. Unwrap butter and place in center of dough, aligning it so that edges of butter and dough are flush at top and bottom. Fold two sides of dough over butter so they meet in center of butter square.  
2. Using fingertips, press seam together. Using rolling pin, press firmly on each open end of packet. Roll dough out lengthwise until it is 24 inches long and 8 inches wide.  
3. Starting at bottom of dough, fold into thirds like business letter. Turn dough 90 degrees and roll and fold into thirds again. Place on baking sheet, wrap tightly with plastic wrap, and return to freezer for 30 minutes. Roll and fold into thirds one more time.  
SHAPING THE CROISSANTS  
#instructions  
1. Transfer dough from freezer to lightly floured work surface and roll into 18 by 16-inch rectangle. (If dough begins to retract, fold it loosely in thirds, wrap it, and return it to freezer for 10–15 minutes.) Fold upper half of dough over lower half.  
2. Using ruler, mark dough at 3-inch intervals along bottom edge. Move ruler to top of dough, measure in 1-1⁄2 inches from left, then use this mark to measure out 3-inch intervals. Using pizza wheel or knife, cut dough into triangles from mark to mark.  
3. You should have 12 single triangles and 5 double triangles; discard any scraps. Unfold double triangle and cut in half to form 10 single triangles (making 22 triangles in all). If dough begins to soften, return to freezer for 10 minutes.  
4. Cut 1⁄2-inch slit in center of short side of each triangle. If dough begins to soften, return to freezer for 10 minutes.  
5. Grasp triangle by 2 corners on either side of slit and stretch gently, then grasp point and stretch.  
6. Place triangle on counter so point is facing toward you. Fold both sides of slit down. Positioning palms on folds, roll partway toward point.  
7. Gently grasp point with one hand and stretch; resume rolling, tucking point underneath.  
8. Curve ends gently toward one another to form crescent shape.

DARK CHOCOLATE MOUSSE  
#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
When developing this recipe, we used Callebaut Intense Dark Chocolate and Ghirardelli Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Bar, which each contain about 60 percent cacao. If you want to use a chocolate with a higher percentage of cacao, see our variation, Premium Dark Chocolate Mousse. If you choose to make the mousse a day in advance, let it sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before serving. Serve with WHIPPED CREAM and chocolate shavings, if desired.  
8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped fine  
5 tablespoons water  
2 tablespoons Dutch-processed cocoa  
1 tablespoon brandy  
1 teaspoon instant espresso powder  
2 large eggs, separated  
1 tablespoon sugar  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons heavy cream, chilled  
#instructions  
1. Melt chocolate, water, cocoa, brandy, and espresso in medium heatproof bowl set over saucepan filled with 1 inch barely simmering water, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from heat.  
2. Whisk egg yolks, 1-1⁄2 teaspoons sugar, and salt in medium bowl until mixture lightens in color and thickens slightly, about 30 seconds. Pour melted chocolate into egg yolk mixture and whisk until combined. Let cool until just warmer than room temperature, 3 to 5 minutes.  
3. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip egg whites at medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Add remaining 1-1⁄2 teaspoons sugar, increase speed to medium-high, and whip until soft peaks form, about 1 minute. Using whisk, stir about one-quarter of whipped egg whites into chocolate mixture to lighten it; gently fold in remaining egg whites with rubber spatula until few white streaks remain.  
4. In now-empty bowl, whip cream on medium speed until it begins to thicken, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to high and whip until soft peaks form, about 15 seconds more. Using rubber spatula, fold whipped cream into mousse until no white streaks remain. Spoon mousse into 6 to 8 individual serving dishes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set and firm, at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours. Serve.  
PREMIUM DARK CHOCOLATE MOUSSE  
This recipe is designed to work with a boutique chocolate that contains a higher percentage of cacao than our master recipe.  
Replace bittersweet chocolate (containing about 60 percent cacao) with equal amount of bittersweet chocolate containing 62 to 70 percent cacao. Increase water to 7 tablespoons, increase eggs to 3, and increase sugar to 3 tablespoons, adding extra 2 tablespoons to chocolate mixture in step 1.  
CHOCOLATE-ORANGE MOUSSE  
For best flavor, the orange zest needs to steep in the heavy cream overnight, so plan accordingly. Garnish each serving of mousse with a thin strip of orange zest, if desired.  
Bring cream to simmer in medium saucepan. Off heat, transfer to 2-cup liquid measuring cup and add three 2-inch strips orange zest. Let cool until just warm, cover, and refrigerate overnight. Remove and discard zest; add more cream, if necessary, to equal 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons. Proceed with step 1, reducing water to 4 tablespoons and omitting brandy. Once chocolate is melted, stir in 2 tablespoons Grand Marnier and proceed as directed.  
CHOCOLATE-RASPBERRY MOUSSE  
Chambord is our preferred brand of raspberry-flavored liqueur for this recipe. Serve the mousse with fresh raspberries, if desired.  
Reduce water to 4 tablespoons, omit brandy, and add 2 tablespoons raspberry-flavored liqueur to melted chocolate mixture in step 1.

CHOCOLATE POTS DE CRÈME  
#quantity  
SERVES 8  
#ingredients  

POTS DE CRÈME  
10 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped fine  
5 large egg yolks  
5 tablespoons (2-1⁄4 ounces) sugar  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1-1⁄2 cups heavy cream  
3⁄4 cup half-and-half  
1 tablespoon water  
1⁄2 teaspoon instant espresso powder  
1 tablespoon vanilla extract  
WHIPPED CREAM AND GARNISH  
1⁄2 cup heavy cream, chilled  
2 teaspoons sugar  
1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
Cocoa (optional)  
Chocolate shavings (optional)  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE POTS DE CRÈME: Place chocolate in medium bowl; set fine-mesh strainer over bowl and set aside.  
2. Whisk egg yolks, sugar, and salt together in bowl until combined. Whisk in cream and half-and-half. Transfer mixture to medium saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly and scraping bottom of pot with wooden spoon, until thickened and silky and registers 175 to 180 degrees, 8 to 12 minutes. (Do not let custard overcook or simmer.)  
3. Immediately pour custard through fine-mesh strainer over chocolate. Let mixture stand to melt chocolate, about 5 minutes; whisk gently until smooth. Combine water and espresso and stir to dissolve, then whisk dissolved espresso and vanilla into chocolate mixture. Divide mixture evenly among eight 5-ounce ramekins. Gently tap ramekins against counter to remove air bubbles.  
4. Let pots de crème cool to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours. Before serving, let pots de crème stand at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes. (Pots de crème can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.)  
5. FOR THE WHIPPED CREAM AND GARNISH: Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip cream, sugar, and vanilla on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until stiff peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. Dollop each pot de crème with about 2 tablespoons whipped cream and garnish with cocoa and/or chocolate shavings, if using. Serve.  
MILK CHOCOLATE POTS DE CRÈME  
Milk chocolate behaves differently in this recipe than bittersweet chocolate, and more of it must be used to ensure that the custard sets. And because of the increased amount of chocolate, it’s necessary to cut back on the amount of sugar so that the custard is not overly sweet.

CLASSIC CRÈME CARAMEL  
#quantity  
SERVES 8  
#ingredients  
You can vary the amount of sugar in the custard to suit your taste. Most tasters preferred the full 2⁄3 cup, but you can reduce that amount to as little as 1⁄2 cup to create a greater contrast between the custard and the caramel. Cook the caramel in a pan with a light-colored interior, since a dark surface makes it difficult to judge the color of the syrup. Caramel can leave a real mess in a pan, but it is easy to clean; simply boil water in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes to loosen the hardened caramel.  
CARAMEL  
1⁄3 cup water  
2 tablespoons light corn syrup  
1⁄4 teaspoon lemon juice  
1 cup (7 ounces) sugar  
CUSTARD  
1-1⁄2 cups whole milk  
1-1⁄2 cups light cream  
3 large eggs plus 2 large yolks  
2⁄3 cup (4-2⁄3 ounces) sugar  
1-1⁄2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
Pinch salt  
#instructions  
1. FOR THE CARAMEL: Combine water, corn syrup, and lemon juice in medium saucepan. Pour sugar into center of pan, taking care not to let sugar crystals touch pan sides. Gently stir with spatula to moisten sugar thoroughly. Bring to boil over medium-high heat and cook, without stirring, until sugar is completely dissolved and liquid is clear, 6 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, swirling occasionally, until mixture darkens to honey color, 4 to 5 minutes longer. Working quickly, carefully divide caramel among eight 6-ounce ramekins. Let caramel cool and harden, about 15 minutes. (Caramel-coated ramekins can be refrigerated for up to 2 days; bring to room temperature before adding custard.)  
2. FOR THE CUSTARD: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Combine milk and cream in medium saucepan and heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until steam appears and mixture registers 160 degrees, 6 to 8 minutes; remove from heat. Meanwhile, gently whisk eggs, egg yolks, and sugar in large bowl until just combined. Off heat, gently whisk warm milk mixture, vanilla, and salt into eggs until just combined but not foamy. Strain mixture through fine-mesh strainer into 4-cup liquid measuring cup or bowl; set aside.  
3. Bring kettle of water to boil. Meanwhile, place kitchen towel in bottom of large baking dish or roasting pan and set ramekins on towel (they should not touch). Divide custard evenly among ramekins and set dish on oven rack. Taking care not to splash water into ramekins, pour enough boiling water into dish to come halfway up sides of ramekins; cover dish loosely with aluminum foil. Bake until paring knife inserted halfway between center and edge of custards comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Transfer ramekins to wire rack and let cool to room temperature. (Custards can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.)  
4. To unmold, run paring knife around perimeter of each ramekin. Hold serving plate over top of ramekin and invert; set plate on counter and gently shake ramekin to release custard. Repeat with remaining ramekins and serve.  
ESPRESSO CRÈME CARAMEL  
Espresso beans ground in a coffee grinder would be too fine and impart too strong a coffee flavor to the custard. Instead, crush the beans lightly with the bottom of a skillet.  
Heat 1⁄2 cup lightly crushed espresso beans with milk and cream mixture until steam appears and mixture registers 160 degrees, 6 to 8 minutes. Off heat, cover and let steep until coffee has infused milk and cream, about 15 minutes. Strain mixture through fine-mesh strainer and proceed as directed, discarding crushed espresso beans. Reduce vanilla extract to 1 teaspoon.

CLASSIC CRÈME BRÛLÉE  
#quantity  
SERVES 8  
#ingredients  
Separate the eggs and whisk the yolks after the cream has finished steeping; if left to sit, the surface of the yolks will dry and form a film. A vanilla bean gives the custard the deepest flavor, but 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, whisked into the yolks in step 4, can be used instead. While we prefer turbinado or Demerara sugar for the caramelized sugar crust, regular granulated sugar will work, too, but use only 1 scant teaspoon on each ramekin or 1 teaspoon on each shallow fluted dish.  
1 vanilla bean  
4 cups heavy cream  
2⁄3 cup (4-2⁄3 ounces) granulated sugar  
Pinch salt  
12 large egg yolks  
8–12 teaspoons turbinado or Demerara sugar  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees.  
2. Cut vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Using tip of paring knife, scrape out seeds. Combine vanilla bean and seeds, 2 cups cream, sugar, and salt in medium saucepan. Bring mixture to boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve sugar. Off heat, let steep for 15 minutes.  
3. Meanwhile, place kitchen towel in bottom of large baking dish or roasting pan; set eight 4- or 5-ounce ramekins (or shallow fluted dishes) on towel (they should not touch). Bring kettle of water to boil.  
4. After cream has steeped, stir in remaining 2 cups cream. Whisk egg yolks in large bowl until uniform. Whisk about 1 cup cream mixture into yolks until combined; repeat with 1 cup more cream mixture. Add remaining cream mixture and whisk until evenly colored and thoroughly combined. Strain mixture through fine-mesh strainer into large liquid measuring cup or bowl; discard solids in strainer. Divide mixture evenly among ramekins.  
5. Set baking dish on oven rack. Taking care not to splash water into ramekins, pour enough boiling water into dish to reach two-thirds up sides of ramekins. Bake until centers of custards are just barely set and register 170 to 175 degrees, 30 to 35 minutes (25 to 30 minutes for shallow fluted dishes), checking temperature about 5 minutes before recommended minimum time.  
6. Transfer ramekins to wire rack and let cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. Set ramekins on baking sheet, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until cold, at least 4 hours.  
7. Uncover ramekins; if condensation has collected on custards, blot moisture with paper towel. Sprinkle each with about 1 teaspoon turbinado sugar (1-1⁄2 teaspoons for shallow fluted dishes); tilt and tap each ramekin to distribute sugar evenly, dumping out excess sugar. Ignite torch and caramelize sugar. Refrigerate ramekins, uncovered, to rechill, 30 to 45 minutes; serve.  
ESPRESSO CRÈME BRÛLÉE  
Crush the espresso beans lightly with the bottom of a skillet.  
Substitute 1⁄4 cup lightly crushed espresso beans for vanilla bean. Whisk 1 teaspoon vanilla extract into yolks in step 4 before adding cream.  
TEA-INFUSED CRÈME BRÛLÉE  
Substitute 10 Irish Breakfast tea bags, tied together, for vanilla bean; after steeping, squeeze bags with tongs or press into fine-mesh strainer to extract all liquid. Whisk 1 teaspoon vanilla extract into yolks in step 4 before adding cream.  
FAMILY-STYLE CRÈME BRÛLÉE  
Substitute 11 by 7-inch baking dish for ramekins and bake for 40 to 50 minutes. Let cool to room temperature, 2-1⁄2 to 3 hours.  
MAKE-AHEAD CRÈME BRÛLÉE  
Reduce egg yolks to 10. After baked custards cool to room temperature, wrap each ramekin tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 4 days. Proceed with step 7.  
CARAMELIZING CRÈME BRÛLÉE  
Ignite torch and, holding flame about 2 inches above sugar, slowly sweep flame over sugar until it bubbles and turns deep golden brown.

CLASSIC PANNA COTTA  
#quantity  
SERVES 8  
#ingredients  
A vanilla bean gives the panna cotta the deepest flavor, but 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract can be used instead. If you like, you can omit the Berry Coulis and simply serve the panna cotta with lightly sweetened berries. Though traditionally unmolded, panna cotta may be chilled and served in wine glasses with the sauce on top. If you would like to make the panna cotta a day ahead, reduce the amount of gelatin by 1⁄2 teaspoon and chill the filled wine glasses or ramekins for 18 to 24 hours.  
1 cup whole milk  
2-3⁄4 teaspoons unflavored gelatin  
3 cups heavy cream  
1 vanilla bean  
6 tablespoons (2-2⁄3 ounces) sugar  
Pinch salt  
1 recipe BERRY COULIS  
#instructions  
1. Pour milk into medium saucepan; sprinkle surface evenly with gelatin and let stand for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, turn contents of 2 ice cube trays (about 32 cubes) into large bowl; add 4 cups cold water. Place cream in large measuring cup. Cut vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Using tip of paring knife, scrape out seeds. Add vanilla bean and seeds to cream; set aside. Set eight 4-ounce ramekins on rimmed baking sheet.  
2. Heat milk and gelatin mixture over high heat, stirring constantly, until gelatin is dissolved and mixture registers 135 degrees, about 1-1⁄2 minutes. Off heat, add sugar and salt; stir until dissolved, about 1 minute.  
3. Stirring constantly, slowly pour cream into milk mixture, then transfer to medium bowl and set over bowl of ice water. Stir frequently until slightly thickened and mixture registers 50 degrees, about 10 minutes. Strain mixture through fine-mesh strainer into large liquid measuring cup, then distribute evenly among ramekins. Cover baking sheet with plastic wrap, making sure plastic does touch surface; refrigerate until just set (mixture should wobble when shaken gently), at least 4 or up to 12 hours.  
4. Run paring knife between custard and side of ramekin in 1 smooth stroke. (If shape of ramekin makes this difficult, quickly dip ramekin into hot water bath to loosen custard.) Flip ramekins upside down onto individual serving plates. Shake ramekins gently to unmold panna cotta; lift ramekins from plate and serve with Berry Coulis.  
LEMON PANNA COTTA  
Cut four 2-inch strips lemon zest into thin strips and add to cream along with vanilla bean. Add 1⁄4 cup lemon juice (2 lemons) to strained cream mixture before dividing among ramekins.

SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
To melt the chocolate using a microwave, heat it at 50 percent power for 2 minutes; stir the chocolate, add the butter, and continue heating until melted, stirring once every additional minute. Soufflé waits for no one so be ready to serve it immediately.  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces, plus 1 tablespoon, softened  
1⁄3 cup (2-1⁄3 ounces) plus 1 tablespoon sugar  
8 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped coarse  
1 tablespoon orange-flavored liqueur, such as Grand Marnier  
1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
6 large eggs, separated, plus 2 large whites  
1⁄4 teaspoon cream of tartar  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Grease 2-quart soufflé dish with 1 tablespoon softened butter, then coat dish evenly with 1 tablespoon sugar; refrigerate until ready to use.  
2. Melt chocolate and remaining 4 tablespoons butter in medium heatproof bowl set over saucepan of barely simmering water, stirring occasionally, until smooth. Stir in liqueur, vanilla, and salt; set aside.  
3. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat egg yolks and remaining 1⁄3 cup sugar on medium speed until thick and pale yellow, about 3 minutes. Fold into chocolate mixture.  
4. Using dry, clean bowl and whisk attachment, whip egg whites and cream of tartar on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and whip until stiff peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes.  
5. Using rubber spatula, vigorously stir one-quarter of whipped whites into chocolate mixture. Gently fold in remaining whites until just incorporated. Transfer mixture to prepared dish and bake until fragrant, fully risen, and exterior is set but interior is still a bit loose and creamy, about 25 minutes. (Use 2 large spoons to pull open top and peek inside.) Serve immediately.  
MOCHA SOUFFLÉ  
Add 1 tablespoon instant espresso powder dissolved in 1 tablespoon hot water when adding vanilla to chocolate mixture.  
INDIVIDUAL CHOCOLATE SOUFFLÉS  
Omit 2-quart soufflé dish. Grease eight 8-ounce ramekins with butter and sugar. In step 5, transfer soufflé mixture to ramekins, making sure to completely fill each ramekin and wipe each rim with wet paper towel. Reduce baking time to 16 to 18 minutes.  
MAKE-AHEAD INDIVIDUAL CHOCOLATE SOUFFLÉS  
Omit 2-quart soufflé dish. Grease eight 8-ounce ramekins with butter and sugar. In step 3, bring sugar and 2 tablespoons water to boil in small saucepan, then reduce heat and simmer until sugar dissolves. With mixer running, slowly add sugar syrup to egg yolks and beat until mixture triples in volume, about 3 minutes. Whip egg whites as directed, beating in 2 tablespoons confectioners’ sugar. Stir and fold into chocolate base as directed. Fill each chilled ramekin almost to rim, wiping each rim clean with wet paper towel. Cover each ramekin tightly with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, at least 3 hours or up to 1 month. (Do not thaw before baking.) To serve, heat oven to 400 degrees and reduce baking time to 16 to 18 minutes.

#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
Make the soufflé base and immediately begin beating the whites before the base cools too much. Once the whites have reached the proper consistency, they must be used at once. Do not open the oven door during the first 15 minutes of baking time; as the soufflé nears the end of its baking, you may check its progress by opening the oven door slightly. (Be careful here; if your oven runs hot, the top of the soufflé may burn.) A quick dusting of confectioners’ sugar is a nice finishing touch, but a soufflé waits for no one, so be ready to serve it immediately.  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature, plus 1 tablespoon, softened  
3⁄4 cup (5-1⁄4 ounces) sugar  
2 teaspoons sifted cocoa  
5 tablespoons (1-1⁄2 ounces) all-purpose flour  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1 cup whole milk  
5 large eggs, separated  
3 tablespoons Grand Marnier  
1 tablespoon grated orange zest  
1⁄8 teaspoon cream of tartar  
1⁄2 ounce bittersweet chocolate, finely grated  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Grease 1-1⁄2-quart soufflé dish with 1 tablespoon softened butter. Combine 1⁄4 cup sugar and cocoa in small bowl and pour into prepared dish, shaking to coat bottom and sides of dish evenly. Tap out excess and set dish aside.  
2. Whisk flour, 1⁄4 cup sugar, and salt in small saucepan. Gradually whisk in milk, whisking until smooth and no lumps remain. Bring mixture to boil over high heat, whisking constantly, until thickened and mixture pulls away from sides of pan, about 3 minutes. Scrape mixture into medium bowl; whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons butter until combined. Whisk in egg yolks until incorporated; stir in Grand Marnier and orange zest.  
3. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip egg whites, cream of tartar, and 1 teaspoon sugar on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and whip whites to soft, billowy mounds, about 1 minute. Gradually add half of remaining sugar and whip until glossy, soft peaks form, about 30 seconds; with mixer still running, add remaining sugar and whip until just combined, about 10 seconds.  
4. Using rubber spatula, immediately stir one-quarter of whipped whites into soufflé base to lighten until almost no white streaks remain. Scrape remaining whites into base and fold in whites, along with grated chocolate, with whisk until mixture is just combined. Gently pour mixture into prepared dish and run your index finger through mixture, tracing circumference about 1⁄2 inch from side of dish, to help soufflé rise properly. Bake until surface of soufflé is deep brown, center jiggles slightly when shaken, and soufflé has risen 2 to 2-1⁄2 inches above rim, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve immediately.  
KAHLÚA SOUFFLÉ WITH GROUND ESPRESSO  
If you do not have espresso beans, substitute an equal amount of instant espresso powder, adding it along with the milk in step 2 so that it dissolves.  
Omit orange zest and substitute Kahlúa for Grand Marnier and 1 tablespoon finely ground espresso beans for shaved chocolate.

CHILLED LEMON SOUFFLÉ  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
To make this lemon soufflé “soufflé” over the rim of the dish, use a 1-quart soufflé dish and attach a foil collar; to make the collar, secure a strip of foil that has been sprayed with vegetable oil spray around the soufflé dish so it extends 2 inches above the rim (do this before the dish has been filled). Tape the foil collar to the dish to prevent it from slipping. For those less concerned about appearance, this dessert can be served from any 1-1⁄2-quart serving bowl. For the best texture, serve the soufflé after 1-1⁄2 hours of chilling. It may be chilled for up to 6 hours; though the texture will stiffen slightly. The soufflé can be garnished with fresh mint, raspberries, confectioners’ sugar, or finely chopped pistachios.  
2-1⁄2 teaspoons grated lemon zest plus 1⁄2 cup juice (3 lemons)  
2 teaspoons unflavored gelatin  
1 cup whole milk  
3⁄4 cup (5-1⁄4 ounces) sugar  
2 large eggs, separated, plus 3 large whites, room temperature  
1⁄4 teaspoon cornstarch  
Pinch cream of tartar  
3⁄4 cup heavy cream  
#instructions  
1. Place lemon juice in small bowl; sprinkle gelatin over top and set aside.  
2. Heat milk and 1⁄2 cup sugar in medium saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until steaming and sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks, 2 tablespoons sugar, and cornstarch in medium bowl until pale yellow and thickened. Whisking constantly, gradually add hot milk mixture to yolks. Return milk-egg mixture to saucepan and cook, stirring constantly, over medium-low heat until mixture thickens to consistency of heavy cream and registers 185 degrees, about 4 minutes. Pour mixture through fine-mesh strainer into bowl; stir in lemon juice mixture and zest. Set bowl with custard over large bowl of ice water; stir occasionally to cool.  
3. While custard cools, use stand mixer fitted with whisk to whip egg whites and cream of tartar on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and whip whites to soft, billowy mounds, about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and whip until glossy, soft peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes. (Do not overwhip.) Remove custard from ice-water bath; gently whisk in one-third of egg whites, then fold in remaining whites with rubber spatula until almost no white streaks remain.  
4. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip cream on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until soft peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. Fold whipped cream into custard until no white streaks remain.  
5. Pour custard into 1-quart soufflé dish fitted with aluminum foil collar or 1-1⁄2-quart soufflé dish. Chill until set but not stiff, about 1-1⁄2 hours; remove foil collar, if using, and serve.

Do not open the oven door during the first 7 minutes of baking, but do check the soufflé regularly for doneness during the final few minutes in the oven. Be ready to serve the soufflé immediately after removing it from the oven. Using a 10-inch traditional (not nonstick) skillet is essential to getting the right texture and height in the soufflé.  
5 large eggs, separated  
1⁄4 teaspoon cream of tartar  
2⁄3 cup (4-2⁄3 ounces) sugar  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest plus 1⁄3 cup juice (3 lemons)  
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour  
1 tablespoon unsalted butter  
Confectioners’ sugar  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip egg whites and cream of tartar on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and whip whites to soft, billowy mounds, about 1 minute. Gradually add 1⁄3 cup sugar and salt and whip until glossy, stiff peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Gently transfer whites to clean bowl; set aside.  
2. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk (do not wash bowl), whip egg yolks and remaining 1⁄3 cup sugar on medium-high speed until pale and thick, about 1 minute. Whip in lemon zest, juice, and flour until incorporated, about 30 seconds.  
3. Fold one-quarter of whipped egg whites into yolk mixture until almost no white streaks remain. Gently fold in remaining egg whites until just incorporated.  
4. Melt butter in 10-inch ovensafe skillet over medium-low heat. Swirl pan to coat it evenly with butter, then gently scrape soufflé batter into skillet and cook until edges begin to set and bubble slightly, about 2 minutes.  
5. Transfer skillet to oven and bake soufflé until puffed, center jiggles slightly when shaken, and surface is golden, 7 to 11 minutes. Using potholder (skillet handle will be hot), remove skillet from oven. Dust soufflé with confectioners’ sugar and serve immediately.  
SKILLET CHOCOLATE-ORANGE SOUFFLÉ  
Grating the chocolate fine is key here; we find it easiest to use either a rasp-style grater or the fine holes of a box grater.  
Substitute 1 tablespoon grated orange zest for lemon zest and 1⁄3 cup orange juice for lemon juice. Gently fold 1 ounce finely grated bittersweet chocolate into soufflé batter after incorporating all whites in step 3.

SERVES 6  
#ingredients  
For this recipe, you will need six 6-ounce ramekins and a round cookie cutter of a slightly smaller diameter than the ramekins. If you don’t have the right size cutter, use a paring knife and the bottom of a ramekin (most ramekins taper toward the bottom) as a guide for trimming the rounds. If using challah, slice it about 1⁄2 inch thick. Summer berry pudding can be made up to 24 hours before serving; held any longer, the berries begin to lose their freshness. WHIPPED CREAM is the perfect accompaniment.  
12 slices potato bread, challah, or hearty white sandwich bread  
1-1⁄4 pounds strawberries, hulled and sliced (4 cups)  
10 ounces (2 cups) raspberries  
5 ounces (1 cup) blueberries  
5 ounces (1 cup) blackberries  
3⁄4 cup (5-1⁄4 ounces) sugar  
2 tablespoons lemon juice  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Place bread in single layer on rimmed baking sheet and bake until dry but not brittle, about 1 hour, flipping slices once and rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. Set aside to cool.  
2. Combine strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, and sugar in large saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until berries begin to release their juices and sugar has dissolved, about 5 minutes. Off heat, stir in lemon juice; cool to room temperature.  
3. Spray six 6-ounce ramekins with vegetable oil spray and place on rimmed baking sheet. Use cookie cutter to cut out 12 bread rounds that are slightly smaller in diameter than ramekins.  
4. Using slotted spoon, place 1⁄4 cup fruit mixture in each ramekin. Lightly soak 1 bread round in fruit juice in saucepan and place on top of fruit in ramekin; repeat with 5 more bread rounds and remaining ramekins. Divide remaining fruit among ramekins, about 1⁄2 cup per ramekin. Lightly soak 1 bread round in juice and place on top of fruit in ramekin (it should sit above lip of ramekin); repeat with remaining 5 bread rounds and remaining ramekins. Pour remaining fruit juice over bread and cover ramekins loosely with plastic wrap. Place second baking sheet on top of ramekins and weight it with heavy cans. Refrigerate puddings for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.  
5. Remove cans and baking sheet and uncover puddings. Loosen puddings by running paring knife around edge of each ramekin, unmold into individual bowls, and serve immediately.

CAPPUCCINO SEMIFREDDO WITH BISCOTTI  
#quantity  
SERVES 8  
#ingredients  
For the best results, chill the bowl and whisk attachment before whipping the cream. Drizzle slices of semifreddo with Warm Bittersweet Chocolate Sauce, if desired.  
1 cup heavy cream, chilled  
1⁄2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (4-1⁄3 ounces) sugar  
1⁄4 cup water plus 1 tablespoon warm tap water  
2 tablespoons instant espresso powder  
3 large egg whites, room temperature  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1⁄2 cup crushed almond biscotti or hazelnut biscotti  
#instructions  
1. Line 8-1⁄2 by 4-1⁄2-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving 3-inch overhang all around, and place in freezer. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip cream on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until soft peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer to bowl and refrigerate.  
2. Bring 1⁄2 cup sugar and 1⁄4 cup water to boil in small saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until mixture is slightly thickened and syrupy and registers 235 degrees, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and cover to keep warm.  
3. Combine remaining 1 tablespoon water and espresso in small bowl and stir to dissolve. Using dry, clean bowl and whisk attachment, whip egg whites on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Add 1 teaspoon sugar and increase speed to high; whip until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Gradually whip in remaining 5 teaspoons sugar. Reduce speed to medium and slowly add hot sugar syrup, avoiding whisk and sides of bowl. Increase speed to medium-high and continue to whip until mixture has cooled slightly and is very shiny and thick, 2 to 5 minutes. Add espresso mixture and vanilla.  
4. Gently stir one-third of whipped cream into egg white mixture with rubber spatula; fold in remaining whipped cream and 6 tablespoons crushed biscotti. Transfer mixture to prepared pan, spreading evenly with spatula. Fold overhanging plastic over mixture and press gently onto surface; freeze until firm, at least 8 hours.  
5. To unmold, remove plastic from surface and invert loaf pan onto serving platter. Remove plastic and smooth surface with spatula, if desired. Sprinkle with remaining crushed biscotti. Slice and serve immediately.

FRESH ORANGE SHERBET  
#quantity  
MAKES ABOUT 1 QUART  
#ingredients  
If using a canister-style ice-cream machine, be sure to freeze the empty canister at least 24 hours and preferably 48 hours before churning. For self-refrigerating ice-cream machines, prechill the canister by running the machine for 5 to 10 minutes before pouring in the sherbet. For the freshest, purest orange flavor, use freshly squeezed unpasteurized orange juice (either store-bought or juiced at home). Pasteurized fresh-squeezed juice makes an acceptable though noticeably less fresh-tasting sherbet. Do not use juice made from concentrate, which has a cooked and less bright flavor.  
1 cup (7 ounces) sugar  
1 tablespoon grated orange zest plus 2 cups juice (4 oranges)  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
3 tablespoons lemon juice  
2 teaspoons triple sec or vodka  
2⁄3 cup heavy cream  
#instructions  
1. Pulse sugar, orange zest, and salt in food processor until damp, 10 to 15 pulses. With processor running, add orange juice and lemon juice in slow, steady stream; continue to process until sugar is fully dissolved, about 1 minute. Strain mixture through fine-mesh strainer into medium bowl; stir in triple sec, then cover and place in freezer until chilled and mixture registers about 40 degrees, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Do not let mixture freeze.  
2. When mixture is chilled, using whisk, whip cream in medium bowl until soft peaks form. Whisking constantly, add juice mixture in steady stream, pouring against edge of bowl. Transfer to ice-cream machine and churn until mixture resembles thick soft-serve ice cream, 25 to 30 minutes.  
3. Transfer sherbet to airtight container, press firmly to remove any air pockets, and freeze until firm, at least 3 hours. (Sherbet can be frozen for up to 1 week.)  
FRESH LIME SHERBET  
Substitute lime zest for orange zest, increase sugar to 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons, and omit lemon juice. Substitute 2⁄3 cup lime juice (6 limes) combined with 1-1⁄2 cups water for orange juice.  
FRESH LEMON SHERBET  
Omit orange juice. Substitute lemon zest for orange zest, increase sugar to 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons, and increase lemon juice to 2⁄3 cup (4 lemons). Combine lemon juice with 1-1⁄2 cups water before adding to food processor.  
FRESH RASPBERRY SHERBET  
In-season fresh raspberries have the best flavor, but when they are not in season, frozen raspberries are a better option. Substitute a 12-ounce bag of frozen raspberries for fresh.  
Omit orange zest and juice. Cook 15 ounces (3 cups) raspberries with sugar, salt, and 3⁄4 cup water in medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture just begins to simmer, about 7 minutes.

VANILLA ICE CREAM  
#quantity  
MAKES ABOUT 1 QUART  
#ingredients  
Two teaspoons of vanilla extract can be substituted for the vanilla bean; stir the extract into the cold custard in step 3. An instant-read thermometer is critical for the best results. Using a prechilled metal baking pan and working quickly in step 4 will help prevent melting and refreezing of the ice cream and will speed the hardening process. If using a canister-style ice-cream machine, be sure to freeze the empty canister at least 24 hours and preferably 48 hours before churning. For self-refrigerating ice-cream machines, prechill the canister by running the machine for 5 to 10 minutes before pouring in the custard.  
1 vanilla bean  
1-3⁄4 cups heavy cream  
1-1⁄4 cups whole milk  
1⁄2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (4-1⁄3 ounces) sugar  
1⁄3 cup light corn syrup  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
6 large egg yolks  
#instructions  
1. Place 8- or 9-inch square metal baking pan in freezer. Cut vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Using tip of paring knife, scrape out vanilla seeds. Combine vanilla bean, seeds, cream, milk, 6 tablespoons sugar, corn syrup, and salt in medium saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture is steaming steadily and registers 175 degrees, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat.  
2. While cream mixture heats, whisk egg yolks and remaining 1⁄4 cup sugar in bowl until smooth, about 30 seconds. Slowly whisk 1 cup heated cream mixture into egg yolk mixture. Return mixture to saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and registers 180 degrees, 7 to 14 minutes. Immediately pour custard into large bowl and let cool until no longer steaming, 10 to 20 minutes. Transfer 1 cup custard to small bowl. Cover both bowls with plastic wrap. Place large bowl in refrigerator and small bowl in freezer and let cool completely, at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours. (Small bowl of custard will freeze solid.)  
3. Remove custards from refrigerator and freezer. Scrape frozen custard from small bowl into large bowl of custard. Stir occasionally until frozen custard has fully dissolved. Strain custard through fine-mesh strainer and transfer to ice-cream machine. Churn until mixture resembles thick soft-serve ice cream and registers about 21 degrees, 15 to 25 minutes. Transfer ice cream to frozen baking pan and press plastic wrap on surface. Return to freezer until firm around edges, about 1 hour.  
4. Transfer ice cream to airtight container, press firmly to remove any air pockets, and freeze until firm, at least 2 hours. (Ice cream can be frozen for up to 5 days.)  
TRIPLE GINGER ICE CREAM  
Freeze the crystallized ginger for at least 15 minutes before adding it to the churning ice cream.  
Omit vanilla bean. Add one 3-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced into thin rounds, and 2 teaspoons ground ginger to cream and milk mixture in step 1 and heat as directed. Add 1⁄2 cup chopped crystallized ginger to ice cream during last minute of churning.  
COFFEE CRUNCH ICE CREAM  
Look for chocolate-covered cocoa nibs (roasted pieces of the cocoa bean) in chocolate shops or well-stocked supermarkets. Freeze the cocoa nibs for at least 15 minutes before adding them to the churning ice cream.  
Omit vanilla bean. Add 1⁄2 cup coarsely ground coffee to cream and milk mixture in step 1 and heat as directed. Add 3⁄4 cup chocolate-covered cocoa nibs to ice cream during last minute of churning.

FRESH PEACH ICE CREAM  
#quantity  
MAKES ABOUT 1 QUART  
#ingredients  
Both the cooked peaches and the custard mixture must be cooled to 40 degrees before you churn them. An instant-read thermometer is critical for the best results. You’ll get the very best results from using in-season, fully ripened peaches, but in a pinch, you can substitute 2 cups frozen sliced peaches and replace the vodka with peach-flavored liqueur. If your peaches are firm, you should be able to peel them with a sharp vegetable peeler. If they are too soft to withstand the pressure of a peeler, you’ll need to blanch them in a pot of simmering water for 15 seconds and then shock them in a bowl of ice water before peeling. Though the frozen ice cream will keep in the freezer for up to 2 days, its flavor and texture are best when it is eaten the day it is made.  
1 pound peaches, peeled, halved, pitted, and cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces  
1 cup plus 6 tablespoons (9-2⁄3 ounces) sugar  
1⁄2 teaspoon lemon juice  
Pinch salt  
1-1⁄3 cups heavy cream  
1-1⁄4 cups whole milk  
6 large egg yolks  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
2 tablespoons vodka  
#instructions  
1. Combine peaches, 1⁄2 cup sugar, lemon juice, and salt in bowl; let stand until pool of syrupy liquid accumulates and peaches soften slightly, 1 to 1-1⁄2 hours.  
2. Place fine-mesh strainer over medium bowl and set over larger bowl of ice water. Combine cream, milk, and 1⁄2 cup sugar in medium saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture is steaming steadily and registers 175 degrees, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat.  
3. While cream mixture heats, whisk egg yolks and remaining 6 tablespoons sugar in bowl until smooth, about 30 seconds. Slowly whisk half of heated cream mixture into egg yolk mixture, 1⁄2 cup at a time. Return mixture to saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and registers 180 degrees, 7 to 14 minutes. Immediately strain custard through fine-mesh strainer and let cool over bowl of ice water to room temperature, stirring occasionally. Stir in vanilla, then cover and refrigerate until custard registers 40 degrees, at least 3 hours or up to 24 hours.  
4. Meanwhile, transfer peaches and their liquid to medium saucepan and heat, stirring occasionally, over medium-high heat until tender and flesh has broken down, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to bowl, stir in vodka, and refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours.  
5. Strain chilled peaches through fine-mesh strainer, reserving liquid. Stir reserved peach liquid into chilled custard; transfer custard to ice-cream machine and churn until mixture resembles soft-serve ice cream, 25 to 30 minutes. Add peaches; continue to churn until combined, about 30 seconds. Transfer ice cream to airtight container, press firmly to remove any air pockets, and freeze until firm, at least 2 hours.  
LIGHTER FRESH PEACH ICE CREAM  
Increase peaches to 1-1⁄2 pounds and reduce sugar to 1 cup. Increase milk to 1-1⁄2 cups and reduce heavy cream to 1⁄4 cup, egg yolks to 4, and vodka to 1-1⁄2 tablespoons. For each sugar addition, use 1⁄3 cup.

1⁄2 cup (1-1⁄2 ounces) Dutch-processed cocoa  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
1⁄8 teaspoon baking soda  
2 large eggs  
2⁄3 cup (4-2⁄3 ounces) sugar  
1⁄4 cup (2-3⁄4 ounces) chocolate syrup  
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
2 pints vanilla, chocolate, or coffee ice cream  
#instructions  
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease 18 by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet and line with parchment paper.  
2. Sift flour, cocoa, salt, and baking soda in medium bowl. Beat eggs, sugar, and chocolate syrup in large bowl until mixture is combined and light brown. Add melted butter and whisk until fully incorporated.  
3. Add dry ingredients to egg mixture. With rubber spatula, gradually incorporate dry ingredients; stir until batter is evenly moistened and no dry streaks remain. Pour batter into prepared sheet; using offset spatula, spread batter evenly in pan. Bake until cookie springs back when touched, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. Let cool in pan on wire rack for 5 minutes, then run paring knife around edges of sheet to loosen. Invert cookie onto large cutting board; carefully peel off parchment. Cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.  
4. Using 2-3⁄4- to 3-inch round biscuit cutter, cut 16 rounds from baked cookie. Using serrated knife, slice away bottoms of ice-cream containers. Dip knife in warm water, wipe clean, and slice four 3⁄4-inch-thick rounds from each container, cutting through cardboard. Peel away and discard cardboard. Using same biscuit cutter, cut out rounds from each ice-cream slice. Assemble ice-cream sandwiches, placing ice-cream round on cookie bottom, then topping with another cookie, shiny side up. Serve immediately or freeze on aluminum foil–lined baking sheet, covered with foil, for up to 3 hours. (Sandwiches can be frozen, wrapped individually in waxed paper, then foil, for up to 1 week; let sandwiches sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before serving.)  
CUTTING ICE-CREAM ROUNDS

CLASSIC CARAMEL SAUCE  
#quantity  
MAKES ABOUT 2 CUPS  
#ingredients  
If you don’t own a candy thermometer, follow the time approximations in the recipe and watch the color of the sugar syrup; it should be a deep amber color before the cream is added. To keep the sauce from clumping, make sure the cream is hot before adding it to the sugar syrup; try to coordinate it so that the cream reaches a simmer when the sugar syrup reaches 350 degrees.  
1 cup water  
2 cups (14 ounces) sugar  
1 cup heavy cream  
Pinch salt  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled  
#instructions

BERRY COULIS  
#quantity  
MAKES ABOUT 1-1⁄2 CUPS  
#ingredients  
Because the type of berries used as well as their ripeness will affect the sweetness of the coulis, the amount of sugar is variable. Start with 5 tablespoons, then add more if you prefer a sweeter coulis. Additional sugar should be stirred in immediately after straining, while the coulis is still warm, so that the sugar will readily dissolve. Serve the coulis with cheesecake, pound cake, ice cream, rich chocolate tortes and cakes, dessert soufflés, pancakes, French toast, waffles, or crêpes.  
12 ounces (3 cups) fresh or frozen and thawed raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, and/or strawberries (hulled and sliced thin if fresh)  
1⁄4 cup water  
5–7 tablespoons sugar  
1⁄8 teaspoon salt  
2 teaspoons lemon juice  
#instructions  
1. Bring berries, water, 5 tablespoons sugar, and salt to bare simmer in medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally; cook until sugar is dissolved and berries are heated through, about 1 minute.

CLASSIC LEMONADE  
#quantity  
SERVES 6 TO 8  
#ingredients  
If you like, scrape the pulp from a couple of mashed lemon slices into the pitcher to make a more pulpy lemonade. Adding 1 tablespoon of grenadine turns the lemonade pink and imparts extra sweetness.  
12 lemons, halved from top to bottom and sliced thin  
1-1⁄4 cups sugar  
Pinch salt (optional)  
5 cups water  
Mash lemons, sugar, and salt, if using, in large, deep bowl or saucepan with potato masher or wooden spoon until lemon slices give up their juice, sugar is dissolved, and juice is thickened to syrup consistency, about 4 minutes. Pour half of lemon slices and syrup through large strainer set over bowl or saucepan; press on solids with masher or back of wooden spoon to release as much liquid as possible. Discard solids; transfer liquid to serving pitcher. Repeat process with remaining lemon slices. Stir in water until blended. Chill at least 1 hour and stir to blend before serving.  
LEMONADE FOR ONE  
Reduce number of lemons to 2, sugar to 3 tablespoons, and water to 3⁄4 cup. Use small bowl and strainer.  
LIMEADE  
Substitute 16 limes, halved from top to bottom and sliced thin, for the lemons.  
MINTED LEMONADE  
Like the ginger version below, the mint flavor in this lemonade is mild to complement the lemon.  
Add 2 cups fresh mint leaves to lemons and sugar before mashing.  
GINGERED LEMONADE  
Add 3 tablespoons grated fresh ginger to lemons and sugar before mashing.  
RASPBERRY LEMONADE  
Add 7-1⁄2 ounces fresh or thawed frozen raspberries to lemons and sugar before mashing.  
SHANDY  
Other versions of this refreshing British drink substitute ginger beer or ginger ale, or lemon-lime soda for the lemonade. We prefer 1 part beer to 2 parts lemonade. For a stronger beer flavor, use equal parts beer and lemonade.  
1⁄3 cup beer, preferably dark or amber lager or light or pale ale, chilled  
2⁄3 cup lemonade, chilled  
Pour beer, then lemonade, into glass. Stir very gently to avoid creating foam and serve immediately.

QUICK, SIMPLE, FULL-FLAVORED ICED TEA  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
Doubling this recipe is easy, but use a large saucepan and expect the water to take a few minutes longer to reach the proper temperature. For a slightly stronger iced tea, reduce the amount of ice to 3 cups. Garnish with a thin lemon wedge to squeeze into the tea, if you like.  
5 bags black tea  
4 cups water  
1–6 tablespoons sugar  
4 cups ice cubes, plus more for glasses  
Tie strings of tea bags together (for easy removal) and heat with water in medium saucepan over medium heat until dark colored, very steamy, and small bubbles form on bottom and sides of pan (tea will register about 190 degrees), 10 to 15 minutes. Off heat, let steep for 3 minutes (no longer or tea may become bitter). Remove tea bags; pour tea into pitcher. Stir in sugar to taste, then stir in ice until melted. Serve in ice-filled glasses.  
MINTED ICED TEA  
Add 1⁄4 cup fresh mint leaves, bruised with wooden spoon, to saucepan along with tea bags and water. When steeping is complete, remove tea bags and strain tea through fine-mesh strainer to remove mint.  
GINGERED ICED TEA  
Add one 1-inch piece fresh ginger, sliced thin and smashed with broad side of large chef’s knife, to saucepan along with tea bags and water. When steeping is complete, discard tea bags and strain tea through fine-mesh strainer to remove ginger.  
MICROWAVE ICED TEA  
Using a 2-quart Pyrex measuring cup makes this tea a one-pot drink from brewing to pouring. Exact heating time will depend on the power of your microwave and the starting temperature of the water.  
Microwave tea bags and water, covered, until dark colored, very steamy, and water starts to move but not boil (tea will register about 190 degrees), 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from microwave and let steep for 3 minutes (no longer or tea may become bitter). Remove tea bags. Stir in sugar to taste, then stir in ice until melted. Serve in ice-filled glasses.

THE BEST FRESH MARGARITAS  
#quantity  
SERVES 4 TO 6  
#ingredients  
The longer the zest and juice mixture is allowed to steep, the more developed the citrus flavors will be in the finished margaritas. We recommend steeping for the full 24 hours, although the margaritas will still be great if the mixture is steeped for only the minimum 4 hours. If you’re in a rush and want to serve margaritas immediately, omit the zest and skip the steeping process altogether. If you can’t find superfine sugar, process an equal amount of granulated sugar in a food processor for 30 seconds.  
4 teaspoons finely grated lime zest plus 1⁄2 cup juice (4 limes)  
4 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest plus 1⁄2 cup juice (3 lemons)  
1⁄4 cup superfine sugar  
Pinch salt  
2 cups crushed ice  
1 cup 100 percent agave tequila, preferably reposado  
1 cup triple sec  
#instructions  
1. Combine lime zest and juice, lemon zest and juice, sugar, and salt in large liquid measuring cup; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until flavors meld, at least 4 or up to 24 hours.

Add tequila, triple sec, and remaining 1 cup crushed ice; stir or shake until thoroughly combined and chilled, 20 to 60 seconds. Strain into ice-filled glasses and serve immediately.  
FRESH PINEAPPLE MARGARITAS  
The pineapple flavor in this variation makes the zest and steeping process in the recipe above unnecessary.  
Omit lime and lemon zest and steeping process. Peel, core, and halve 1 small ripe pineapple (about 3-1⁄2 pounds); cut 1 half into rough 2-inch chunks (reserve remaining half for another use). Process in food processor until smooth and foamy, about 1 minute. Add 1⁄2 cup pureed pineapple to juice mixture, reducing lemon and lime juices to 1⁄4 cup each.  
FRESH RASPBERRY MARGARITAS  
Omit lime and lemon zest and steeping process. Puree 1 cup fresh raspberries, lime and lemon juices, sugar, and pinch salt in food processor until smooth, about 1 minute. Strain mixture into pitcher or cocktail shaker. Continue with recipe, reducing triple sec to 1⁄2 cup and adding 1⁄2 cup Chambord (or other raspberry liqueur) to juice and tequila mixture in pitcher.

THE BEST SANGRIA  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
The longer sangria sits before drinking, the more smooth and mellow it will taste. A full day is best, but if that’s impossible, give it an absolute minimum of 2 hours to sit. Use large, heavy, juicy oranges and lemons for the best flavor. If you can’t find superfine sugar, process an equal amount of granulated sugar in a food processor for 30 seconds. Doubling or tripling the recipe is fine, but you’ll need a large punch bowl in place of the pitcher. An inexpensive Merlot is the best choice for this recipe.  
2 oranges, 1 sliced, 1 juiced (1⁄2 cup)  
1 lemon, sliced  
1⁄4 cup superfine sugar  
1 (750-ml) bottle fruity red wine, chilled  
1⁄4 cup triple sec  
6–8 ice cubes  
#instructions  
1. Add sliced orange, lemon, and sugar to large pitcher. Mash fruit gently with wooden spoon until fruit releases some juice, but is not totally crushed, and sugar dissolves, about 1 minute. Stir in orange juice, wine, and triple sec; refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 8 hours.  
2. Before serving, add 6 to 8 ice cubes and stir briskly to distribute settled fruit and pulp; serve immediately.

Leftover mulled wine can be reheated in the microwave or in a saucepan on the stovetop. Merlot, Pinot Noir, or Côtes du Rhône are the best choices for this recipe.  
3 cinnamon sticks  
10 whole cloves  
10 whole peppercorns  
1 teaspoon allspice berries  
2 (750-ml) bottles red wine  
4 (2-inch) strips orange zest

HOLIDAY EGGNOG  
#quantity  
SERVES 12 TO 16  
#ingredients  
Adding the milk to the eggs in small increments and blending thoroughly after each addition helps ensure a smooth custard. To prevent curdling, do not heat the custard beyond 160 degrees. If it does begin to curdle, remove it from the heat immediately, pour it into a bowl set over a larger bowl of ice water to stop the cooking, and proceed with the recipe. You can omit the brandy to make a nonalcoholic eggnog, but you should also decrease the cream to 1⁄4 cup to keep the right consistency. Increase the cream to 3⁄4 cup and add another 1⁄2 cup brandy for stronger eggnog.  
6 large eggs plus 2 large yolks  
1⁄2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar  
1⁄4 teaspoon salt  
4 cups whole milk  
1⁄2 cup brandy, bourbon, or dark rum  
1 tablespoon vanilla extract  
1⁄2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, plus extra for garnish  
1⁄2 cup heavy cream  
#instructions  
1. Whisk eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and salt together in heavy 3- or 4-quart saucepan. Stir in milk, 1⁄2 cup at a time, blending well after each addition. Heat slowly over lowest possible heat, stirring constantly, until custard registers 160 degrees, thickens, and coats back of spoon, 25 to 30 minutes. Pour custard through fine-mesh strainer into large bowl; stir in brandy, vanilla and nutmeg. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 3 hours or up to 3 days.  
2. Just before serving, whip cream in medium bowl to very soft peaks and gently fold into custard mixture until incorporated. Serve in chilled punch bowl or cups, garnishing with nutmeg.

2. Add milk, increase heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until steam rises from surface and tiny bubbles form around edge, 12 to 15 minutes. Do not boil.  
3. Add vanilla and half-and-half. Divide between 4 mugs and serve immediately.  
HOT COCOA WITH ORANGE

IRISH COFFEE  
#quantity  
SERVES 4  
#ingredients  
For sweet and creamy coffee, add 1 tablespoon of Bailey’s Irish Cream to each mug.  
1⁄2 cup Irish whiskey  
4 cups fresh brewed coffee, hot  
Sugar (optional)  
1 recipe WHIPPED CREAM  
Pour 2 tablespoons whiskey into each of 4 large mugs. Fill mugs with coffee. Season with sugar, if desired, and dollop with whipped cream before serving.  
RECOMMENDED BREWING METHODS  
FRENCH PRESS  
#instructions  
1. Preheat pot with hot tap water. Add 2 tablespoons medium-coarse ground coffee for every 6 ounces water. Add just-boiled water steadily, saturating all grounds.  
2. Simply pouring boiled water over coffee grounds isn’t enough for great flavor. To aid flavor extraction, use long spoon or chopstick to gently stir coffee.  
3. Add lid and steep coffee for about 5 minutes (4 minutes for smaller pots). With even pressure, steadily press down filter.  
MANUAL DRIP  
#instructions  
1. Warm thermos with hot tap water. Add 2 tablespoons medium ground (for paper filters) or medium-fine ground (for metal filters) coffee for every 6 ounces water to filter.  
2. Pour 1⁄2 cup just-boiled water over grounds, saturating thoroughly; let stand 30 seconds.  
3. Pour remaining hot water over grounds, in batches if necessary, stirring gently after each addition.

BUYING AND STORING BASICS  
BUY FRESHLY ROASTED WHOLE BEANS: Buying whole beans in small quantities is important because grinding speeds oxidation and the deterioration of flavor. Even grinding the night before can make a big difference; studies show the exposed coffee cells begin to break down within the hour.  
STORE AWAY FROM HEAT AND LIGHT: If you plan to finish a bag of beans in less than 10 or 12 days, you can store them at room temperature in the original bag or a zipper-lock bag away from heat and light. For longer-term storage, store the beans in the freezer to limit contact with air and moisture. (Skip the fridge because the beans will pick up off-flavors.) It’s also a good idea to buy coffee in a heat-sealed, aluminized Mylar bag with a one-way degassing valve (sometimes no more than a bump) that releases carbon dioxide while keeping out oxygen. Unopened, these bags keep beans as fresh as the day they were roasted for up to 90 days.

BEST BREWING PRACTICES  
USE FILTERED WATER: A cup of coffee is about 98 percent water, so it makes sense to pay attention to the water you’re using. If your tap water tastes bad or has strong mineral flavors, your coffee will, too. But don’t bother buying bottled water—just use a filtration pitcher.  
MATCH BREWING TIME TO GRIND: Brewing time will dictate how you grind the coffee. In general, the longer the brewing time, the coarser the grounds should be. To adjust the strength of your coffee, adjust the amount of grounds; the norm is 2 tablespoons of ground beans for every 6 ounces of water.  
PAY ATTENTION TO TEMPERATURE: The most desirable flavor compounds in coffee are released in water between 195 and 205 degrees. A panel of our tasters judged coffee brewed at 200 degrees as having the fullest, roundest flavor. Once the water has boiled (212 degrees), let it rest for 10 to 15 seconds to bring it down to this temperature.
